["A lack of communication between government departments has meant self-confessed war criminals have not been deported or even investigated for their crimes after their asylum claims were rejected, according to the Home Office.\n\nAs many as 135 suspected war criminals have been left at liberty in Britain over the past three years after the Home Office rejected their asylum applications but did not forward their details to the appropriate agency for them to be deported, or to the police for their crimes abroad to be investigated. The actions of the individuals \u2014 40 in 2015, 50 in 2014, and 45 in 2013 \u2014 came to light as Home Office officials assessed the asylum claims of those wishing to become permanent residents of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt was claimed by those seeking asylum that they could not return to their home nations \u2014 because the war crimes they had committed there meant if they went back they would be killed or tortured by their fellow countrymen. The Daily Mail reports that \u201chundreds\u201d of people who had played roles in the wars in Rwanda, Afghanistan, Libya, Serbia, and Sri Lanka have come to Britain.\n\nWhile the claims of the 135 were rejected, meaning they could no longer legally stay in the United Kingdom, they were not deported. The Home Office has now said the loophole has been closed, meaning self-confessed war criminals who presented catalogues of their actions as a reason to not be deported will now be properly investigated by the Metropolitan Police\u2019s war crimes unit.\n\nThe paper reports the concern of human rights charity Amnesty International spokesman Allan Hogarth, who said of the revelation: \u201cOn the face of it, it\u2019s hard to understand how all these individuals could have raised such serious concerns during a citizenship process yet apparently nothing at all be done over potentially putting these people on trial.\n\n\u201cIf there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person here has been involved in acts of torture, war crimes or even genocide in a foreign country then surely the Home Office must be alerting the police and prosecution authorities who have a duty to act.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely mustn\u2019t let Britain become some kind of bolthole for war criminals. Officials need to explain what\u2019s happened here and what their policy is on referring such cases for further investigation and potential prosecution\u201d.\n\nOther European nations have been more proactive in dealing with war criminals who have travelled to the continent among the millions of migrants who have arrived over the course of the migration crisis. Breitbart London reported in April on German police who arrested a migrant they said had been responsible for war crimes during the Syrian civil war.\n\nProsecutors said the migrant had been the commander of a militia which had treated enemies \u201cinhumanely\u201d and had plundered ancient artifacts including priceless works of art which they attempted to sell.", "The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) has released a report concluding that Russian airstrikes have killed more Syrian civilians than the Syrian forces or the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in January.\n\nThe watchdog group found the Russian forces killed 679 civilians in the month, \u201cincluding 94 children and 73 women.\u201d\n\nSNHR collects information from civilians on the ground. They insist their members document all victims with their \u201cfull name, place, and date of death.\u201d But the group admits they cannot \u201creach and document every incident, especially in cases of massacres and siege where government forces besiege a town or a village and cut off communications.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very much likely that the actual death toll us [sic] larger than what we were able to document mainly because government forces don\u2019t allow any rights organization [sic] to operate in its territories,\u201d wrote SNHR.\n\nRadical Islamic groups slaughtered 101 civilians.\n\nThe Islamic State \u201ckilled 98 civilians, including a child and 21 women.\u201d The al-Nusra Front, a group linked to al-Qaeda, killed three people.\n\nSNHR also found that unidentified groups killed 41 civilians and opposition forces killed 42. Kurdish forces killed three people, including one allegedly under torture.\n\n\u201cSNHR affirms that government forces, its militias (Shabiha) and the Russian forces have violated the principles of the human rights international laws which protect the right to life,\u201d the group concluded. \u201cAll the evidences and eyewitnesses\u2019 testimonies prove that more than 90% of the wide and individual attacks targeted civilians and civil points. This contradicts with the Syrian government forces\u2019 claims that it is fighting \u2018Al-Qaeda and terrorists.'\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cSNHR implies that those killing actions amount to crimes against humanity which are committed as part of a widespread and systemic attack directed against civilians.\u201d\n\nRussia began airstrikes in Syria on September 30. The defense ministry insisted the forces target places occupied by the Islamic State, but the attacks allegedly hit areas held by groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nLast week, United States Secretary of State John Kerry met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and others in Munich to discuss an immediate ceasefire. Lavrov tried to push the agreement to March 1, but Kerry demanded the ceasefire begin now. The agreement does \u201cnot apply to Islamic State and other militant groups fighting in Syria.\u201d\n\nHowever, Syrian officials have slammed Russia for continued bombings despite the ceasefire agreement.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten used to conferences and words put into hope, but what we need is action \u2014 and the action that I see is that Russia is killing Syrian civilians,\u201d exclaimed former Syrian Prime Minister Riad Hijab.\n\nOn Monday, missiles hit five hospitals and two schools, killing over 50 civilians. Doctors Without Borders ran one of the hospitals. The United States and aid groups pointed the finger at Russia.\n\nRussian officials quickly denied involvement.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly against such claims, the more so, since each time those who come up with such charges prove unable to somehow confirm their groundless accusations,\u201d retorted Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman.\n\nPeskov claimed sources told Riyadh Haddad, Syrian ambassador to Russia, that the United States destroyed the hospitals and schools.\n\n\u201cMonday was the worst day for attacks on health care facilities for more than six months,\u201d lamented Carolyn Miles, president of Save the Children U.S. \u201cNew information gathered by Save the Children and other organizations suggests that in total, seven facilities were bombed in airstrikes, more than was first reported. The attacks happened across Syria \u2014 in Aleppo, Idlib and Dara\u2019a provinces.\u201d", "So far, Republicans in Congress haven\u2019t notched many legislative successes in the first year of the Trump administration. Their last great hope now is tax reform. But the nation still is without a budget, with lawmakers needing to cut a deal on federal spending for this fiscal year. And, if Thursday\u2019s reports are true, those putting together that vehicle are preparing to take a wrong turn on the road to fiscal responsibility.\n\nCongressional leaders and the White House reportedly want to move ahead with a two-year budget deal that would conveniently put off any further decisions on debt and spending until after the 2018 midterm elections. In the process, they would raise statutory spending caps by about $182 billion, an amount that would be offset only partially, if at all. What\u2019s driving lawmakers to blow through budget caps established in the Budget Control Act? There is bipartisan support for a big spending increase to build up our military. Beyond that, some Republicans will object if the deal does not include funding for Trump\u2019s long-promised border wall. As for the Democrats, they are all but sure to object to any deal that doesn\u2019t match defense-spending increases with equal increases for domestic programs.\n\nCongressional leaders and the White House reportedly want to move ahead with a two-year budget deal that would conveniently put off any further decisions on debt and spending until after the 2018 midterm elections.

Refusing to repeal Obamacare as promised, ignoring the growth in unsustainable entitlement spending, and citing the need to protect national security and provide for our troops but using that as an excuse to bulldoze the only spending limit erected in a generation?\n\nThe consequences of runaway spending and debt are well known. They crowd out private investment, strain the economy, and risk full-scale fiscal crisis as the bloated U.S. budget treads on thinning ice. Every independent analysis repeats those warnings again, and again \u2014 only to be ignored.\n\nIf the threat of a fiscal crisis isn\u2019t enough to make Republicans take the issue seriously, you\u2019d think their experience this fall trying to pass tax reform without blowing up the deficit would. If what they\u2019ve produced isn\u2019t the once-in-a-generation tax plan that conservatives were rooting for, we can blame the bipartisan spending problem. If this plan is too timid, it is because lawmakers\u2019 hands are tied by sky-high deficits and debt. Economic growth is being held back because lawmakers will not agree to curb spending, and they are forced to hedge tax reforms instead of fully releasing our nation\u2019s economic potential.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether a unified package will end up on the president\u2019s desk. Meanwhile, congressional leaders find themselves in a difficult spot, pinching every penny and forced to push politically dicey provisions to reduce the deficit impact of the tax bill, because spending is too high to do otherwise. All the while, they ignore the risk that their treasured tax reform will soon be undone if they fail to control spending and the deficit.\n\nThe way out isn\u2019t complicated. The Budget Control Act is not perfect, but it has worked, reining in spending from all-time highs in the Obama years. It has also shown the potential for well-constructed fiscal rules to incentivize better budget management \u2014 something that\u2019s essential to the work of pulling the U.S. back from the brink of fiscal crisis.\n\nTo see Republicans instead turn around and march in the opposite direction would be a severe disappointment indeed.", "Secretary of State John Kerry said this week he is seeking more evidence against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) to label their crimes genocide.\n\n\u201cI will make a decision on it as soon as I have that additional evaluation and we will proceed forward from there,\u201d Kerry told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Assistance.\n\nRep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE) has sponsored a resolution to declare Islamic State crimes as genocide. H. Con. Res. 75 states:\n\nExpressing the sense of Congress that those who commit or support atrocities against Christians and other ethnic and religious minorities, including Yezidis, Turkmen, Sabea-Mandeans, Kaka\u2018e, and Kurds, and who target them specifically for ethnic or religious reasons, are committing, and are hereby declared to be committing, \u201cwar crimes\u201d, \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d, and \u201cgenocide\u201d.

The Commission of the Bishops\u2019 Conference of the European Union (COMECE) welcomed the decision.\n\n\u201cCOMECE welcomes today\u2019s European Parliament\u2019s resolution as a significant step forward in facilitating measures to prevent the on-going incipient genocide against Christians and other minorities,\u201d the bishops declared in a press release.\n\nIt is the \u201cfirst time the body has recognized an ongoing conflict as a genocide.\u201d The Parliament recommended that everyone \u201cwho intentionally commit[s] atrocities for ethnic or religious reasons should be brought to justice for violations against international law, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State has slaughtered thousands of people as they have expanded their caliphate across Syria and Iraq. People and organizations have suggested calling their actions genocide, but as Christian Today suggests, no one took the final step, \u201cwith one fear being that it would oblige outside bodies and agencies to take stronger action against the terror group.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that the Parliament passed it, on a political level and a moral level. The significance is the obligations that follow by such a recognition,\u201d explained Lars Adaktusson, Swedish member of the parliament. \u201cThe collective obligation to intervene, to stop these atrocities and to stop the persecution in the ongoing discussion about the fight against the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nLast July, Pope Francis pleaded for the world to finally call the slaughter of thousands of Christians a genocide.\n\n\u201cToday we are dismayed to see how in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world many of our brothers and sisters are persecuted, tortured and killed for their faith in Jesus,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIn this third world war, waged piecemeal, which we are now experiencing, a form of genocide is taking place, and it must end.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations toyed with the idea that the group \u201cmay have committed\u201d genocide and war crimes despite the overwhelming evidence.\n\nIslamic State militants abducted 88 Eritrean Christians in Libya. They also beheaded 21 Coptic Christians on a Libyan beach, when one of the terrorists promised the group will conquer Rome. In July 2014, Andrew White, the vicar of the only Anglican church in Iraq, told BBC Radio 4 that Christianity is coming to an end in the Middle Eastern country.\n\nCharity group Barnabas Fund reported the group has tortured and crucified thousands of Christians in Syria. The country has lost over two-thirds of its Christian population since 2011, leaving them with 250,000. Militants attacked Assyrian Christian towns in northern Syria where they burned churches and captured more than 200 Christians. No one knows their fate. They even burned alive an 80-year-old Christian woman.\n\nThe militants have also beheaded, raped, and forced many to convert to Islam. They also sell the females into sex slavery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming. Eighteen months ago we said we will demand action,\u201d said Nuri Kino, director of A Demand for Action. \u201cToday, we can say with pride that we, a team of volunteers from all over the world, worked around the clock to make this happen. Now our goal is the U.N. Security Council. Action must be taken.\u201d", "An Iraqi Shiite militia group calling itself the \u201cIraq Special Operation Force\u201d claims it settled the fate of a captured Islamic State jihadi by giving Instagram users an hour to vote for either freedom or death, and imposing a death sentence when the online vote called for it.\n\n\u201cYou can vote For (kill him or let him go) You have one houer to vote We will post his fate after one houer Tag your friends and take your right take your reveng from isis right now.

It is currently not accessible and appears to have been shut down.\n\nBefore it was shut down, the @iraqiswat account had been gleefully posting its news clippings, with claims such as \u201cGoogle going crazy with our page,\u201d and invitations to \u201ctag your friends for more live revenge vote video killing ISIS with no mercy.\u201d\n\nInternational Business Times reports the Iraq Special Operation Force was dismayed at Instagram deleting their \u201cvote for death\u201d post, but declared, \u201cWe promise you next time you can vote for de fat ***s and show some Lov.\u201d They also promised \u201cvictory soon, death to ISIS\u201d and declared, \u201cMosel, here we come\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Islamic State\u2019s stronghold in Iraq, the city of Mosul.\n\nIf the Instagram vote actually did occur, international legal expert Gideon Boas told the Guardian that the Iran-linked Shiite militia would be guilty of war crimes, for executing a prisoner without due process.", "German police have arrested Syrian migrant in Germany who they say participated in crimes during the Syrian civil war.\n\nGerman Federal prosecutors have alleged that a Syrian migrant they identified as Ibrahim Al F. was commander of a rebel militia in Aleppo that had committed atrocities and plundered ancient artefacts during the ongoing Syrian conflict. Ibrahim was detained Wednesday on a German arrest warrant in Westphalia reports theLocal.\n\nProsecutors released a statement after the arrest saying, \u201cthe accused is strongly suspected of treating people entitled to protection under international humanitarian law cruelly and inhumanely in the autumn of 2012 during the Syrian civil war,\u201d and he is believed to have commanded a militia consisting of 150 jihadi fighters under the banner of the Islamist Ghuraba al-Sham group who were at the time a coalition partner of the Free Syrian Army.\n\nThe Free Syrian Army (FSA) emerged as the chief opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s Syrian Arab Army (FAA) along with the Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra front.\n\nOfficials said that the militia was less interested in pursuing a strategy of beating the SAA forces and rather used the conflict to enrich themselves saying that the group had only, \u201cself serving aims.\u201d\n\nThe atrocities the group are said to have committed under the command of Ibrahim al F. include the torture and kidnapping of those who stood in their way of war plunder. The prosecutor told media, \u201ctwo residents who tried to protect their neighbouring district from plundering are believed to have been captured by the accused and his fighters and held for several days at a makeshift prison under their control,\u201d and they told how the prisoners were \u201ctortured repeatedly in the accused\u2019s presence and by him personally.\u201d\n\nThe militia is sad to have kidnapped at least six other people during the course of their stay in Aleppo and attempted to make money from them by ransoming them to family members.\n\nIn Aleppo they plundered various ancient artefacts from homes and museums on more than one occasion after the FAA forces retreated from various districts of the historic city. Some of the artefacts included priceless works of art which the group attempted to sell unsuccessfully.\n\nSince the migrant crisis began, governments have been finding participants of the Syrian civil conflict who have fled the country for various reasons. Some have fled because they are civilians and it no longer safe for them. Others have fled because they are ISIS agents like the jihadi commander who was caught in a German asylum home earlier this year.\n\nWar criminals are also fleeing Syria to Europe in the wake of several victories by the army of Bashar al Assad. Fearing reprisal for their actions they join other migrants and in this case and in Finland they are caught, but some are worried that many remain at large across Europe.", "The number and cost of federal regulations increased substantially in 2015, as regulators continued to tighten restrictions on American businesses and individuals. The addition of 43 new major rules last year increased annual regulatory costs by more than $22 billion, bringing the total annual costs of Obama Administration rules to an astonishing $100 billon-plus in just seven years.\n\nThe effects of this rampant rulemaking are widespread. Among them: higher energy rates from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d; increased food prices for both people and pets as a result of excessively prescriptive food production standards; restricted access to credit for consumers and small businesses under Dodd\u2013Frank financial regulations; fewer health care choices and higher medical costs because of the Affordable Care Act; and reduced Internet investment and innovation under the network neutrality rules dictated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nThe tide of regulation is expected to rise even higher in 2016\u2014President Barack Obama\u2019s final year in the White House. Historically, rulemaking increases as Presidents scramble to fulfill their regulatory agenda before leaving office. With 144 new rules already in the pipeline, Americans should be prepared for a regulatory surge before year\u2019s end.\n\nIn a post-Obama era, the need for reform of the regulatory system will be greater than ever before. Immediate reforms should include the requirement that legislation undergo an impact analysis before a floor vote in Congress, as well as a requirement that every major regulation obtain congressional approval before taking effect. Sunset deadlines should be required for all major rules, and independent agencies should be subject to the same White House regulatory review as executive branch agencies.[1]\n\nMeasuring 2015\u2019s Red Tape\n\nRegulation acts as a stealth tax on the American people and the U.S. economy. The weight of this tax is crushing, with independent estimates of total regulatory costs exceeding $2 trillion annually\u2014more than is collected in income taxes each year.[2] This estimate, however useful as a general guide, is far from precise and likely modest.[3]\n\nMuch more information is available on the year-to-year changes in the regulatory burden. Since the 1970s, most regulatory agencies have been required to analyze the costs and benefits of new rules.[4] Using this information, it is possible to identify trends in regulation. The most comprehensive source of data on new regulations is the Federal Rules Database maintained by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).[5]\n\nNumber of New Rules. As documented by the GAO, federal regulators issued 2,353 new rules during the 2015 \u201cpresidential year.\u201d[6] Of these, 81 were classified as \u201cmajor,\u201d meaning that they were expected to impose annual costs of $100 million or more.\n\nOf these 81 rules, 31 were budgetary or administrative in nature, such as those setting Medicare payment rates or hunting limits on migratory birds. Those actions do not increase or decrease restrictions on private-sector activity. A total of 43 were rules that increased regulatory burdens on individuals or businesses\u2014a near-record high, exceeded only once since 1996.[7] Seven others decreased restrictions on private activity.\n\nAltogether, during the seven years of the Obama Administration, 229 such major rules have been imposed. Since 2001, a total of 355 such major rules have been imposed.\n\nCost of New Rules. The new regulations are costly as well as numerous, with agencies reporting new annual costs of almost $23 billion in 2015.[8] Very little of this cost was offset by decreases in regulations. In 2015, only seven major rules decreased regulatory burdens, bringing the Administration\u2019s seven-year total to 26, with a claimed savings of $3.4 billion. That compares to 32 such actions, with claimed savings of $2.5 billion, during President George W. Bush\u2019s Administration.\n\nOverall, the cost of major rules issued in 2015 by the Obama Administration\u2014net of regulatory decreases\u2014totaled more than $22 billion, bringing the seven-year cumulative increase in regulatory costs to almost $108 billion annually.[9] Combined with the regulatory burdens imposed during the George W. Bush Administration, the cost of red tape has increased by $176 billion since 2001. Even that figure understates the actual costs, for reasons discussed below.[10]\n\nOn-Budget Costs of Regulation. As the number of regulations grows, so does government spending on regulatory enforcement. According to the latest budget figures compiled by Susan Dudley and Melinda Warren (of George Washington University and Washington University in St. Louis, respectively), administering red tape in fiscal year 2015 was forecast to cost taxpayers more than $57 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent over 2014, and 83 percent more than in 2001.[11] Part of the cost is the increasing number of regulators who write and enforce ever more rules. Dudley and Warren report that there were 277,000 employees at regulatory agencies in 2015, an all-time high.\n\nRegulations of 2015\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dominated rulemaking in 2015, accounting for nine of the 43 new major rules, and increasing annual regulatory costs by $11.1 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services (including the Food and Drug Administration), ranked second, with nine major rules totaling more than $2.4 billion, and the Department of Energy (DOE) was third, with six new energy conservation standards for appliances that increased annual regulatory costs by $1.6 billion.\n\nCostly Power Plan. The EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan,[12] the centerpiece of the Obama Administration\u2019s global warming crusade, was the single most costly regulation imposed in 2015\u2014with $7.2 billion in annual costs, according to the agency (and far more according to critics).[13]\n\nThe rule represents the first direct regulation of so-called greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants.[14] It dictates state-specific restrictions on GHG emissions, with a target reduction of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Regardless of whether GHG emissions actually increase global temperatures, the volume of reductions under the Clean Power Plan are effectively meaningless as a proportion of total emissions. According to the EPA, the Clean Power plan will reduce carbon emissions by 870 million tons by 2030.[15] But the amount of \u201cextra\u201d carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere increases by 50 billion tons annually.[16] Therefore, the Clean Power Plan, at a cost of $7.2 billion each year, will cut the annual increase of CO2 emissions by a mere 0.01 percent\u2014that is one-one hundredth of a percent.\n\nThe real effects are hardly beneficial.[17] Eliminating coal and restricting other carbon-based fuels for electricity production will jeopardize the reliability of the power grid and raise energy prices across the economy. Indeed, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the Clean Power Plan will more than double the number of coal-fired power-plant closures than would otherwise occur absent the regulation.[18] Not only will electricity rates increase, but so will the prices of virtually all U.S. products, because energy is a primary component of all manufacturing. Low-income families and fixed-income seniors will be hardest hit, of course; higher prices consume a larger proportion of their assets. Higher prices also dampen consumer demand, which imperils jobs.\n\nMore than 150 stakeholders, including 27 states, have filed suit challenging the Clean Power Plan as a violation of the EPA\u2019s regulatory authority. On February 22, the Supreme Court issued a stay to halt implementation of the regulation until the lower court determines its validity.\n\nOzone Standard. The EPA\u2019s second-most costly regulation of 2015 imposed a stricter standard for ground-level ozone,[19] which added $1.4 billion to annual compliance costs (excluding $800 million for California[20]). The agency has set the new primary standard at 70 parts per billion (ppb), down from the previous standard of 75 ppb.[21]\n\nOzone is one of the six \u201ccriteria pollutants\u201d that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review every five years. The agency originally planned to set a standard of 65 ppb in August 2011, which some analysts projected would cost $1.1 trillion over two decades, making it one of the most costly regulations ever devised.[22] However, the 65 ppb standard was rejected by President Obama, who reportedly was concerned that his 2012 reelection campaign could be hurt by such a burdensome regulation.[23]\n\nThe new ozone standard of 70 ppb will push hundreds of communities out of compliance, and force states to devise plans to limit industrial activity and transportation projects, as well as replace existing emissions control equipment with more advanced (and costly) systems.[24]\n\nThe EPA and environmental lobbyists dismiss concerns about regulatory costs by touting the (supposed) public health benefits to come. In reality, as much as 75 percent of the benefits of the ozone rule cited by the agency are credited to a reduction in particulate matter, not ozone, which is already controlled by other regulations.[25]\n\nUnnavigable Water Rules. Also of particular consequence in 2015 was the EPA\u2019s rule on the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d (issued jointly with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers). The rule constitutes a new definition for the waters that the federal government can regulate under the Clean Water Act\u2014a response to two rulings by the Supreme Court holding that the EPA and Army Corps overstepped their authority.\n\nThe Clean Water Act applies to \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d which are defined as \u201cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\u201d This notoriously vague definition has for decades invited the Corps and the EPA to stretch their authority. No surprise, then, that the agencies\u2019 2015 definition of authority covers virtually all waters in the nation and, by extension, much of the land use, from farming to home building.[26]\n\nAt the behest of more than two dozen states, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has blocked implementation of the rule while litigation proceeds. If it somehow survives legal scrutiny, the new definition would trample property rights and override the important role that states play in water stewardship. Property owners will lose their ability to derive value from their land. Beyond being an affront to individual liberty, this will restrict investment, hurt property values, and curtail property tax revenues. Farmers, too, are deeply concerned that their land-use practices will be restricted, thereby reducing their productivity\u2014and income.\n\nUnaffordable Care Rules. Six years after passage of the Affordable Care Act, the government\u2019s increased involvement in the nation\u2019s health care system still figures prominently in the regulatory landscape. A search of the Federal Register turns up a total of 34 regulations in 2015 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2014including three from the Department of Health and Human Services that qualify as \u201cmajor.\u201d Among these is a rule dictating which preventive health care services must be covered under employer-provided health insurance policies. The list includes hormonal birth control and sterilization, as well as \u201cemergency contraceptives that prevent implantation of an embryo\u201d\u2014effectively abortion\u2014regardless an employer\u2019s religious objections. The rule sets up a process for obtaining an employer exemption, if they are deemed \u201celigible\u201d by the government.\n\nThe FDA Food Police. Congress dramatically expanded government control over the nation\u2019s food supply in 2011 with passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, and it has taken some five years to develop the regulations that dictate how the federal government expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables (and dog food), including rules governing soil, water, hygiene, packing, temperatures, and even what animals may roam which fields and when. It also increased inspections of food \u201cfacilities\u201d and taxes them to do so.\n\nFoodborne illness is indeed a public health concern. However, America\u2019s food supply is remarkably safe, and yet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cast an exceedingly broad regulatory net rather than focusing on the biggest risks. That means higher food costs across the board without regard to consumer benefit. In addition to consumers, the biggest burden will fall on small farms and \u201clocal\u201d food producers who are forced to implement controls, training, and record-keeping systems fashioned for much larger operations. And because the rules are rigid, producers of specialty crops are particularly concerned that advances in food science and technology will become more difficult to adopt.\n\nProponents claim that the rules will reduce incidents of foodborne illness and death. But as noted by Richard Williams of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, \u201cFor some of the rules, there is very little evidence that they actually address a significant food safety problem. For others, the FDA has been unable to provide evidence that the rules will be effective at reducing foodborne risk.\u201d[27]\n\nEver More Rules from Dodd\u2013Frank. Five years in and the hundreds of regulations mandated by the Dodd\u2013Frank financial regulation act continue to arrive: six in 2015, with billions of dollars in new annual costs. Indeed, virtually no aspect of the securities and banking systems remains unaffected by the act, which encompassed 850 pages of legislative text.\n\nAs of the end of 2015, 271 rulemaking deadlines had passed, and rules were finalized for 75 percent of them. Proposed rules are pending for another 34 (12.5 percent), while there remain 33 rulemakings still outstanding.[28]\n\nNew margin and capital requirements for some swap dealers, a joint rulemaking among five agencies, were the second costliest regulation of 2015, at $4.7 billion annually.\n\nDodd\u2013Frank also mandated new data collection requirements for mortgage lenders, which were implemented\u2014and then some\u2014in 2015 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 797-page rule produced by the bureau vastly exceeds the authority provided under Dodd\u2013Frank. Instead of just nine data fields, lenders will have to report 45 separate data points about mortgage applicants, borrowers, and the underwriting process; the property securing the loan; features of the loan; and other unique identifiers.\n\nAmong the most politicized regulations of 2015 was the Pay Ratio Disclosure rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rule requires a public company to disclose the total pay of its CEO and its median-paid employee, and the ratio between the two. The \u201cdisclosure\u201d is not material to assessing the expected return from investing in a company, which historically has been the purpose of disclosure rules.[29] Instead, the Pay Ratio Disclosure is intended to highlight \u201cincome inequality\u2019 as a political device. But such requirements impose unwarranted costs that reduce the return on shareholder investments. And, by adding to already voluminous disclosure requirements, they make it more difficult for investors to find more important material.\n\nDOE Power Politics. In 2015, the DOE added to its profusion of rules restricting the energy used by appliances and other electrical gadgets (at the expense of consumer choice). Targets last year included fluorescent lamps, commercial icemakers, ceiling fans, vending machines, industrial equipment, and boilers. These new standards increase annual regulatory costs by a reported $1.6 billion.[30]\n\nThe DOE has imposed dozens of such mandates based on the very broad authority granted to it by Congress under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. The law requires any new energy standards to be \u201ctechnologically feasible\u201d and \u201ceconomically justified\u201d\u2014standards that the DOE has often ignored.\n\nFor each of these rules, the DOE counted as a benefit the energy savings to owners from more efficient equipment and appliances. But such \u201cprivate benefits\u201d constitute a substitution of the regulator\u2019s preference for that of consumers and entrepreneurs. Whether energy savings are worth the higher cost of a more efficient item is a decision that consumers and business owners can and should make for themselves. Taking away their ability to make that choice is not a benefit; it is, in fact, a steep cost.\n\nFCC Neutralizing the Internet. One of the most significant regulations adopted in 2015 after contentious debate is the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s misnamed \u201cOpen Internet Order.\u201d The order did two things. First, it reclassified \u201cInternet access\u201d as a common carrier service under the Communications Act of 1934. This seemingly technical change subjects Internet service providers, such as Verizon and T-Mobile, to comprehensive FCC regulation of their businesses, under a framework devised for 19th-century railroads.\n\nSecond, using this new-found power, the FCC imposed \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d requirements for treating all bits of content travelling over transmission networks in exactly the same way. Never mind that cat videos and digital 911 calls ought to be treated differently; forced neutrality has been pushed relentlessly by Internet firms that see benefits in constraining their rivals, and well as activists with a fundamental distrust of markets. As a result of these new rules, not only will investment and growth in the Internet be chilled, but innovation itself will be hindered, as firms find themselves compelled to ask permission from the FCC prior to making service changes.[31]\n\nNeither the effects of this rule, nor possible alternatives to this regulatory approach, were analyzed in any formal way. As an independent agency, the FCC is not required to prepare a regulatory impact analysis, not even an assessment of costs and benefits, before imposing new regulations. In fact, far from relying on a reasoned analysis, the FCC\u2019s decision reportedly was driven by the last-minute intervention of President Obama, who publicly called for the FCC to expand the more limited regulatory approach the agency had been planning. As a result, the net neutrality rules suffered from political interference in their formulation, without the benefit of scrutiny under the White House\u2019s own regulatory review process.\n\nThe new rules have been challenged in federal appeals court, which heard the case in December 2015.\n\nQuantifying Costs and Benefits\n\nExecutive Order 1353, issued in 2011 by President Obama, directs agencies to adopt a regulation only if the benefits justify the costs, and to \u201cuse the best available techniques to quantify anticipated present and future benefits and costs as accurately as possible.\u201d Analyzing costs is necessary to identify the trade-offs inherent in rulemaking, and to determine the most efficient and effective course of action among various alternatives. It is also crucial information that allows the public to hold regulators accountable. Without such information, regulators are free to act on a whim.\n\nHowever, agencies very often fail to quantify the costs\u2014and overstate the benefits\u2014of their rules. In some cases, this is unavoidable because costs cannot always be quantified (for instance, for technologies not invented or the loss of religious freedom). But in many instances in 2015, as in years past, agencies simply failed to conduct a cost analysis. Exacerbating matters, independent agencies are exempt from the Executive Order.\n\nFor example, there was no analysis prepared by the Federal Reserve System for its regulatory capital rules although it requires the largest bank holding companies to retain an additional $200 billion as a buffer against losses.\n\nLikewise, as discussed above, the FCC did not analyze the cost of its Internet regulation despite the potential for massive effects on network investment.\n\nThe absence of cost analyses represents a major dysfunction in the rulemaking process. How is the public to judge the efficiency of a regulation or hold agencies accountable for effectively managing a problem if the costs of a rule are estimated to range, say, from $290 million to $2.05 billion\u2014as was the case with a rule setting margin requirements for uncleared swaps promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission?\n\nOther agencies have gone to great lengths to negate regulatory costs altogether. The Environmental Protection Agency,[32] for instance, actually claimed there would not be any direct costs from its \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d rule, which vastly expands the agency\u2019s powers over virtually every body of water\u2014as well as vast tracts of land. According to the EPA, the rule simply redefined its regulatory powers, and a definitional change does not produce costs; it is the application of the new definition that produces costs.\n\nThe results of some cost-benefit analyses are so skewed that it is nearly impossible to imagine that the agency fully considered the necessity of the rule. The regulatory impact analysis for the EPA\u2019s 2015 coal ash regulation, for example, reported annual costs ($509 million) that were twice as high as the benefits ($236 million). The agency cited 11 other benefits, but claimed that those benefits could not be monetized \u201c(d)ue to uncertainties and weaknesses in supporting documentation.\u201d[33]\n\nThen there are the DOE\u2019s conservation standards for commercial air conditioners and furnaces. The annual cost is estimated to be $708 million a year, but the agency touts as a benefit the electricity cost savings that supposedly will accrue to appliance owners (for instance, $104 in energy savings over 13.4 years of ownership). But, as stated above, such \u201cprivate benefits\u201d constitute a substitution of the regulator\u2019s preference for that of consumers and entrepreneurs.\n\nFederal agencies also often mask politically driven regulations as scientifically based imperatives. In such cases, agencies fail to properly perform scientific and economic analyses, or selectively pick findings from the academic literature to justify their actions and ignore evidence that contradicts their agenda.\n\nThe Administration\u2019s new Clean Power Plan rule exemplifies some of the most problematic elements of improper rulemaking. The regulation is the first direct regulation of CO2 emissions from power plants, and it effectively bans construction of coal-fired electricity-generating units. The agency estimates that compliance costs will be $6.6 billion annually\u2014a figure widely contested as low by industry. But the benefits calculation used to justify the rule is even more dubious than the cost calculation.\n\nSimply put, the only way the EPA could show that the benefits of the power plan rule exceed the costs was to count presumed benefits worldwide rather than just in the United States\u2014an invalid approach. Ascribing benefits to the entire globe shrinks the relative costs to a more acceptable figure. But Americans are paying the costs, and they should know what they are getting in return. Second, the agency ascribes the majority of benefits to health impacts associated with the reduction of ancillary air pollutants that are already controlled under other regulations. This regulatory sleight of hand is all too common for regulations that otherwise would cost far more than they return in benefits.\n\nFor executive branch agencies, the integrity of cost analyses is the responsibility of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). There is currently a large backlog of regulations awaiting review at this office. According to OIRA data, 21 of the 133 regulations (21 percent) awaiting review in May had been pending for more than 90 days, exceeding the maximum time allotted under Executive Order 12866, which governs the review process. Another 22 regulations (16.5 percent) were pending for more than 60 days (though fewer than 90 days).\n\nIf the delays in OIRA\u2019s review were the result of more thorough analyses, or consideration of regulatory alternatives, that would be good news for the economy and consumers. But it is far from clear that this is the case. OIRA\u2019s meager staff of approximately 45 is outnumbered 6,000 to one by the regulators whose work they are charged with reviewing.[34] This would be a difficult job even with the support of the President. It is all the more difficult under the present Administration, which has hardly made controlling regulatory costs a priority.\n\nGiven these and other problems, it is no surprise that the overall quality of agency cost-benefit analyses is low. In a Mercatus Center scorecard of the quality of agency regulatory impact analyses, none of the 130 analyses examined received more than a 2.8 score of a possible 5.0\u2014meaning each was incomplete in some material way.[35]\n\nCountdown to Midnight Regulations\n\nThe 2015 regulatory surge could be exceeded in 2016 if the Administration fulfills its regulatory agenda\u2014in which more than 2,000 rules are either in the proposal stage or in the process of being finalized. Of these, 144 are expected to have an impact on the private sector of $100 million or more annually, including yet more energy-efficiency mandates for home and commercial appliances, additional food-labeling requirements, Obamacare requirements, greenhouse gas limits for trucks, and more Dodd\u2013Frank financial regulations.\n\nNot all of the items in the regulatory agenda are typically completed in a given year. But a much higher portion will likely be pushed through in 2016, the last year for the Obama Administration. This pattern holds for both Democratic and Republican Administrations, and regardless of the incoming President\u2019s party affiliation. In 2008, for instance, George W. Bush imposed 36 new major rules, far above his average in other years of about 20 annually. Large spikes were also recorded in the last year of the George H. W. Bush Administration, and even when Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency was ending, even though he was replaced by another Republican.\n\nA disproportionate amount of this regulatory activity takes place after the general election and before inauguration of the new chief executive. Such \u201cmidnight\u201d regulations are particularly problematic because the lame duck regulators issuing the rules have little or no accountability. In an institutional sense, they face no tomorrow, and no responsibility for their actions.[36]\n\nTo his credit, Howard Schelanski, President Obama\u2019s OIRA chief, has urged regulators to complete high-priority rulemakings by the summer to avoid an \u201cend of year scramble\u201d and provide enough time for OIRA review.[37] It is unclear, however, how successful his plea will be. Similar efforts to forestall last-minute rulemaking were made by OIRA at the end of the Bush Administration without notable success, and that was under an Administration less friendly to new regulation.\n\nLegislation to limit such last-minute rulemaking is pending. H.R. 4612, the Midnight Rule Relief Act, sponsored by Representative Tim Walberg (R\u2013MI), would bar promulgation of major rules between Election Day and the inauguration of the new President. Even without new legislation, Congress could control midnight rules through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows lawmakers to reject major regulations within 60 legislative days of a submission to Congress.[38] The CRA is usually of only limited value, because\u2014in order to reject a rule\u2014the President must sign the resolution of disapproval of his own Administration\u2019s policy decision. In the case of an end-of-term regulation, however, the incoming President reviews his predecessor\u2019s work. This provides an opportunity for Congress and the new President to veto midnight rules, and he or she should use it.\n\nRecommendations for Reform\n\nCongress should increase scrutiny of existing and new regulations to ensure that each is constitutional and necessary, and that costs are minimized. A broad set of reforms have been put forward to accomplish this.\n\nRegulatory Budgeting: An Imperfect Solution. One frequently proposed approach is to establish a \u201cbudget\u201d for regulations, similar to the fiscal budget for direct expenditures.[39] Agencies would be prohibited from imposing new regulatory costs above the amount provided for in that budget.\n\nThis approach has a certain appeal to it. Government rules, some argue, are like taxation and spending, so why not place them under a budget like other taxes and expenditures? Making those costs explicit and limiting how many rules could be imposed would supposedly force policymakers to scrutinize regulations, and to make trade-offs between competing regulatory priorities.[40]\n\nHowever, unresolved issues surround this concept. For instance, would agencies be able to shift priorities internally, or would those priorities be set in the budget, as are line-items in fiscal budgets? If they are not able to shift priorities, their incentives to avoid non-cost-effective rules would be negated. If they are able to do so, the accountability of Congress and the White House would be blunted.\n\nBut there is a more fundamental issue concerning regulatory budgeting. Regulatory cost estimates are notoriously inaccurate and imprecise at present and subject to political manipulation. This is a particular concern with proposals that require baseline estimates of the cost of the existing stock of regulation on the books. Moreover, cost is only one element of regulatory impact\u2014and not always the most important. But regulatory budgeting would treat every regulation as equal, dollar-for-dollar, when they most definitely are not. There is also the dilemma of how to deal with non-quantifiable costs. How is lost innovation from Internet regulation to be scored, or the loss of religious freedom in mandating contraception coverage? Would these very real costs simply be ignored in a regulatory budget?\n\nProponents acknowledge that regulatory budgeting does have limitations, but argue that any curb on regulation is worth a try. But a flawed budgeting system could be worse than the status quo, especially given regulators\u2019 ability to game the system. And, just as Congress virtually ignores the fiscal budget, there is no reason to think that lawmakers would hold the executive branch accountable for regulatory budgeting. If anything, they are more likely to leverage such a budget for political purposes. Perhaps these and other limitations will be overcome in the future, or a work-around can be found.[41] But the problems cannot be ignored.\n\nA Red Tape Reform Agenda. Beyond regulatory budgeting, there are many other reforms which policymakers should pursue. Policymakers should:\n\nRequire congressional approval of new major regulations issued by agencies. Congress, not regulators, should make the laws and be accountable to the American people for the results. No major regulation should be allowed to take effect until Congress explicitly approves it. Legislation to require such congressional approval for all major rules, known as the REINS Act (Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny) passed the House in July 2015,[42] but is still awaiting action in the Senate. In addition, legislators should include requirements for congressional approval of rules in every bill that expands or re-authorizes regulation. Such an approach would demonstrate how REINS Act requirements work in practice, paving the way for their broader application.\n\nCongress, not regulators, should make the laws and be accountable to the American people for the results.

Such an approach would demonstrate how REINS Act requirements work in practice, paving the way for their broader application. Create a congressional regulatory analysis capability. In order to exercise regulatory oversight, especially if the REINS Act is adopted, Congress needs to be able to analyze various regulatory policies objectively. Congress currently depends on the White House\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or the regulatory agencies themselves, for analyses, and needs an independent source of expertise. This could be accomplished through an existing congressional institution, such as the Congressional Budget Office or the GAO, or through a new unit established by Congress. This new capability need not require a net increase in staff or budget, but could easily be paid for through reductions in existing regulatory agency expenses.\n\nIn order to exercise regulatory oversight, especially if the REINS Act is adopted, Congress needs to be able to analyze various regulatory policies objectively.

This new capability need not require a net increase in staff or budget, but could easily be paid for through reductions in existing regulatory agency expenses. Automatically sunset obsolete regulations. While the REINS Act would strengthen review of new regulations, measures for reviewing existing red tape are also necessary. In 2011, President Obama, with great fanfare, launched a retrospective review, or \u201clookback\u201d initiative, instructing regulatory agencies to root out obsolete regulations. The White House cites 179 rules that have been eliminated with billions of dollars in savings.[43] Notwithstanding such claims, the initiative has barely made a dent in regulatory burdens. Since 2011, in fact, less than $2.4 billion in savings have been reported from deregulatory actions. To make retrospective review more effective, Congress should set sunset dates for all major regulations. Rules should expire automatically if not explicitly reaffirmed by the relevant agency through the formal rulemaking process. As with any such regulatory decision, this reaffirmation would be subject to review by the courts. Such sunset clauses already exist for some regulations. Congress should make them the rule, not the exception.\n\nCodify regulatory impact analysis requirements. All executive branch agencies are currently required to conduct regulatory impact analysis (including cost-benefit calculations) when imposing any major regulation. Codifying these requirements would ensure that they cannot be rolled back without congressional action, and provides the basis for judicial review of agency compliance.\n\nAll executive branch agencies are currently required to conduct regulatory impact analysis (including cost-benefit calculations) when imposing any major regulation. Codifying these requirements would ensure that they cannot be rolled back without congressional action, and provides the basis for judicial review of agency compliance. Subject \u201cindependent\u201d agencies to executive branch regulatory review. Rulemaking is increasingly being conducted by independent agencies outside the direct control of the White House. Regulations issued by agencies, such as the FCC, the SEC, and the CFPB are not subject to review by OIRA or even required to undergo a cost-benefit analysis. This is a gaping loophole in the rulemaking process. These agencies should be fully subject to the same regulatory review requirements as executive branch agencies. Such a requirement has broad support, even from President Obama\u2019s former OIRA chief, Cass Sunstein.[44]\n\nRulemaking is increasingly being conducted by independent agencies outside the direct control of the White House.

In such cases, agencies fail to properly perform scientific and economic analyses or selectively pick findings from the academic literature to justify their actions and ignore evidence that contradicts their agenda. Congress should impose specific strict information-quality standards for rulemaking, and conduct oversight to ensure that the standards are met. Congress should also make compliance with such standards subject to judicial review, and explicitly state that noncompliance will cause regulation to be deemed \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nFederal agencies too often mask politically driven regulations as scientifically based imperatives.

Regulators often work in concert with advocacy groups to produce settlements to lawsuits that result in greater regulation. Such collaboration has become a common way for agencies to impose rules that otherwise would not have made it through the regulatory review process. To prevent such \u201cfaux\u201d settlements, agencies should be required to subject proposed settlements to public notice and comment. The Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act (H.R. 712) would do just that.\n\nRegulators often work in concert with advocacy groups to produce settlements to lawsuits that result in greater regulation.

OIRA is one of the only government entities in Washington that is charged with limiting, rather than producing, red tape. More resources should be focused on OIRA\u2019s regulatory review function. This should be done at no additional cost to taxpayers: The necessary funding should come from cuts in the budgets of regulatory agencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe addition in 2015 of 43 new major regulations with $22 billion in annual costs brings the Obama Administration\u2019s seven-year regulatory total to 229 rules and $108 billion in annual costs. This unparalleled burden spells a decline in economic freedom, replaced by political influence and gamesmanship\u2014all of which inhibits innovation and investment, increases prices, and limits consumer choice.\n\nMuch more regulation is in the pipeline, with another 144 major rules on the Administration\u2019s agenda. Congress must take immediate steps to control this excessive regulation and to prevent further harm to the economy and to the personal liberties of Americans.\n\n\u2014James L. Gattuso is Senior Research Fellow for Regulatory Policy, and Diane Katz is a Senior Research Fellow for Regulatory Policy, in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, of the Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity, at The Heritage Foundation. Heritage Foundation Research Assistant Mollie McNeill provided valuable assistance for this Backgrounder.\n\nAppendix A: Methodology\n\nIn calculating the number and cost of regulations, we only included rules designated as \u201cmajor\u201d in the Government Accountability Office\u2019s Federal Rules Database. Unlike the database maintained by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the GAO\u2019s database includes independent agencies that are not required to submit major rules for executive branch review.\n\nWe included only \u201cprescriptive\u201d rules in the analyses. We excluded rules that do not restrict or mandate private-sector activity from the calculations. Thus, we excluded budgetary rules that set reimbursement rates for Medicaid or conditions for receipt of agricultural subsidies.\n\nCost figures are based on assessments prepared by the rulemaking agency, typically from regulatory impact analyses. In calculating the Bush Administration rules, we used the OMB estimates when available. If an agency did not prepare an analysis or did not quantify costs, no amount was included, although the rule was included in the count of major regulations.\n\nThe agencies\u2019 totals were adjusted to constant 2015 dollars using the gross domestic product deflator at Areppim\u2019s current-dollars converter (http://stats.areppim.com/calc/calc_usdlrxdeflator.php). Where applicable, we used a 7 percent discount rate. Where a range of values was given by an agency, we based costs on the most likely scenario if so indicated by the agency; otherwise, we used the mid-point value. The date of a rule was based on its date of publication in the Federal Register.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, years refer to \u201cpresidential years,\u201d beginning on January 21 and ending on January 20.\n\nAppendix B:\n\nMajor Rules that Increase Regulatory Burdens\n\nJanuary, 26, 2015: Department of Energy, \u201cEnergy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for General Service Fluorescent Lamps and Incandescent Reflector Lamps.\u201d This rule mandates stricter energy standards for fluorescent lights, adding hundreds of millions of dollars each year to the cost of lighting equipment.\n\nAnnual Cost: $863.3 million\n\nJanuary 28, 2015: Department of Energy, \u201cEnergy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Automatic Commercial Ice Makers.\u201d The rule restricts the amount of energy used by commercial ice makers. Regulators estimate that manufacturers may lose up to one-eighth of the value of their businesses, with more regulatory costs passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nAnnual Cost: $23 million\n\nFebruary 27, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cNotice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2016.\u201d This rule imposes cost-sharing requirements and other obligations on health insurers to offset the concentration of risks. It also sets user fees for federal health insurance exchanges, and dictates coverage mandates for the 2016 benefits year. The costs will be borne by employers who purchase coverage for their workers, as well as individual policyholders who underwrite the Obamacare subsidies.\n\nAnnual Cost: $7.5 million\n\nMarch 16, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cStandards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters, New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air Furnaces.\u201d This rule imposes efficiency standards for a variety of furnaces and heaters used to warm American homes. The rules are currently being challenged in court.\n\nAnnual Cost: $46.9 million\n\nMarch 19, 2015: Securities and Exchange Commission, \u201cRegulation SBSR\u2014Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information.\u201d This rule requires security-based swap dealers to report information on their swaps to registered swap-data repositories, and requires those dealers to follow data collection and record-keeping procedures for that information.\n\nAnnual Cost: $374.3 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $258.2 million\n\nApril 13, 2015: Federal Communications Commission, \u201cProtecting and Promoting the Open Internet.\u201d This rule re-classifies Internet service as a telecommunications service under the Communications Act, making Internet service providers \u201ccommon carriers\u201d subject to FCC regulation. Using this newly declared authority, the FCC imposed broad \u201cnet neutrality\u201d restrictions on Internet service firms. A lawsuit is pending.\n\nAnnual Cost: No cost-benefit analysis conducted\n\nApril 17, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cHazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities.\u201d This rule regulates the disposal of coal ash, the residue from burning coal. The EPA had considered designating coal ash as a \u201chazardous waste,\u201d but settled on the less onerous category of \u201csolid waste.\u201d However, the cost of the regulation is still expected to exceed half a billion dollars. The rule is currently being challenged in court.\n\nAnnual Cost: $509 million\n\nApril 29, 2015: Department of Homeland Security, \u201cDepartment of Labor Temporary Non-Agricultural Employment of H-2B Aliens in the United States.\u201d This interim final rule adds new requirements to the process of hiring foreign employees under the H-2B visa program. The changes include a longer period for recruiting and hiring U.S. workers, and new rehiring requirements for recent former employees.\n\nAnnual Cost: $1 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $2.3 million\n\nMay 4, 2015: Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \u201cConfined Spaces in Construction.\u201d This rule imposes stricter safety requirements for construction workers in confined spaces, such as manholes, crawl spaces, and attics. The National Association of Home Builders has filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the rules, arguing that they place an unnecessary burden on homebuilding.\n\nAnnual Cost: $60.3 million\n\nMay 8, 2015: Department of Transportation, \u201cEnhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains.\u201d This rule, adopted in the wake of several high-profile train accidents, imposes strict new safety standards for trains carrying high volumes of flammable liquids. The American Petroleum Institute has sued to stop the rules, arguing that the Department of Transportation has not shown that the rules will actually reduce risk.\n\nAnnual Cost: $124 million\n\nJune 8, 2015: Department of Homeland Security, \u201cChanges to the Visa Waiver Program to Implement the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Program and the Fee for Use of the System.\u201d This rule finalized requirements for implementing an electronic authorization system for visa waivers. The system will process travel authorizations for nonimmigrant aliens seeking to enter the United States under a visa waiver.\n\nAnnual Cost: $376 million\n\nJune 23, 2015: Department of Transportation, \u201cElectronic Stability Control Systems for Heavy Vehicles.\u201d This rule requires heavy trucks and buses to have computer-controlled braking and other automatic safety systems.

The redefinition significantly expands the types of water and land areas that are subject to federal wetlands and other regulation. The rule is under challenge in nine separate lawsuits before seven appeals courts. Efforts are also underway in Congress to overturn the rulemaking.\n\nAnnual Cost: $232.5 million\n\nJuly 8, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \u201cPermanent Discontinuance or Interruption in Manufacturing of Certain Drug or Biological Products.\u201d This rule implements provisions of the 2012 FDA Safety and Improvement Act requiring manufacturers of certain approved drugs to notify the agency of interruptions in production that will disrupt supply.\n\nAnnual Cost: $26.5 million\n\nJuly 14, 2015: Department of the Treasury, Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cCoverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d This rule imposes requirements on insurers to cover specific preventative services, including contraceptive services, without cost-sharing payments by the patient. The cost is spread among all policyholders.\n\nAnnual Cost: Costs already accounted for under interim rules.\n\nJuly 15, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cRevising Underground Storage Tank Regulations\u2014Revisions to Existing Requirements and New Requirements for Secondary Containment and Operator Training.\u201d This rule expands EPA requirements for the maintenance, operation, and containment of underground storage tanks.\n\nAnnual Cost: $160 million\n\nJuly 21, 2015: Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Farm Credit Administration, National Credit Union Administration, \u201cLoans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards.\u201d This rule requires flood insurance payments to be put in escrow when government-backed loans are made.\n\nAnnual Cost: $21.2 million\n\nJuly 22, 2015: Department of Defense, \u201cLimitations on Terms of Consumer Credit Extended to Service Members and Dependents.\u201d This rule limits the amount of interest a lender can charge a member of the military, in addition to other constraints on military lending. This will reduce access to credit for military families.\n\nAnnual Cost: $30 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $106 million\n\nAugust 14, 2015: Federal Reserve System, \u201cImplementation of Risk-Based Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies.\u201d This rule, adopted under the Dodd\u2013Frank Act, subjects banks designated as \u201csystemically important\u201d to capital surcharges. The Fed did not quantify either costs or benefits, although it did forecast a temporary reduction in available credit as a likely cost, thus impeding the ability of businesses to obtain loans.\n\nAnnual Cost: No cost-benefit analysis conducted.\n\nAugust 14, 2015: Securities and Exchange Commission, \u201cRegistration Process for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants.\u201d This rule, mandated by Dodd\u2013Frank, requires all security-based swap dealers to register with the SEC and to provide information about business, management, and ownership. Although the quantified costs reported by the SEC are small, the commission acknowledged that non-quantified costs were likely much larger. These other costs include a potential reduction in competition due to the regulatory burden on smaller dealers.\n\nAnnual Cost: $100,000\n\nImplementation Cost: $14.2 million\n\nAugust 18, 2015: Securities and Exchange Commission, \u201cPay Ratio Disclosure.\u201d This SEC rule, mandated by Dodd\u2013Frank, requires companies to report the ratio between the pay of chief executive officers and the median pay of employees. The agency did not quantify any benefits associated with the rule.\n\nAnnual Cost: $536 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $1.3 billion\n\nSeptember 17, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \u201cCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals.\u201d This rule imposes new, stricter safety standards for the production of pet food. Authorized in 2011 by the Food Safety Modernization Act, the new standards are expected to significantly increase the cost of pet food.\n\nAnnual Cost: $1.1 billion\n\nImplementation Cost: $1.7 billion\n\nSeptember 17, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \u201cCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food.\u201d This rule imposes new, stricter, safety standards for the production of food as authorized in 2011 by the Food Safety Modernization Act.\n\nAnnual Cost: $133.8 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $147.9 million\n\nOctober 13, 2015: Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Department of the Treasury, \u201cAutomated Commercial Environment Filings for Electronic Entry/Entry Summary (Cargo Release and Related Entry).\u201d This rule requires importers to switch to a new software system for tracking cargo shipments.\n\nAnnual Cost: $8.6 million\n\nOctober 16, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Secretary, \u201c2015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications.\u201d This rule imposes new standards for electronic health records. The new standards will raise the overall cost of health care.\n\nImplementation Cost: $331.8 million\n\nOctober 23, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cCarbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.\u201d Known as the Clean Power Plan, this mammoth regulation imposes new limits on so-called greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Intended to forestall global warming, the rule is expected to effectively ban coal-fired plants. According to calculations by Heritage analysts,[45] the regulation could increase electricity rates by as much as 17 percent, and destroy some 300,000 jobs. Despite the huge costs, the plan would do little to address global warming. The rule is now being challenged in the courts by 24 states.\n\nAnnual Cost: $7.2 billion\n\nOctober 26, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cNational Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone.\u201d This regulation imposes strict new limits on ozone emissions. The rule will push hundreds of communities out of compliance, and thus bar new manufacturing facilities, and require substantial investments in emissions controls in existing plants.\n\nAnnual Cost: $1.4 billion\n\nOctober 26, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cNESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products.\u201d This rule imposes more stringent emission standards on brick makers. Efforts are underway in Congress to reverse this rule.\n\nAnnual Cost: $26.5 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $69 million\n\nOctober 28, 2015: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \u201cHome Mortgage Disclosure (Regulation C).\u201d This 797-page rule expands reporting requirements under Regulation C and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, adding about 25 new data fields and modifying 12 others. The data collection will allow federal officials to pursue claims of disparate impact against mortgage lenders.\n\nAnnual Cost: $34.1 million\n\nNovember 3, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cEffluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category.\u201d This rule imposes the first federal limits on pollutants that can be discharged as wastewater from steam power generating plants. The rule was finalized pursuant to a court-ordered deadline obtained by the Sierra Club. More legal challenges are expected.[46]\n\nAnnual Cost: $483.7 million\n\nNovember 18, 2015: Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service; Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration; Department of Health and Human Services: \u201cFinal Rules for Grandfathered Plans, Preexisting Condition Exclusions, Lifetime and Annual Limits, Rescissions, Dependent Coverage, Appeals, and Patient Protections Under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d This rule clarifies earlier interim rules regarding the changes in coverage that a health insurer may make without losing its \u201cgrandfathered\u201d status under Obamacare.\n\nAnnual Cost: $223.4 million\n\nNovember 27, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cForeign Supplier Verification Program.\u201d This rule requires food importers to verify that their product was produced in compliance with U.S. standards. The verification costs will increase food prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nAnnual Cost: $435 million\n\nNovember 27, 2015: Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \u201cStandards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption.\u201d This rule prescribes the procedures and practices to reduce the risk of foodborne illness from produce, including biological hazards. With this rule, the FDA has cast an exceedingly broad regulatory net, rather than focusing on the biggest risks. That means higher food costs across the board without regard to consumer benefit.\n\nAnnual Cost: $504 million\n\nNovember 30, 2015: Department of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Federal Reserve System; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Farm Credit Administration; Federal Housing Finance Agency, \u201cMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities.\u201d This regulation, adopted under Dodd\u2013Frank, imposes new margin and capital requirements on swap dealers regulated by banking agencies. The estimated cost of the capital required to be retained ranges from $2.9 billion to $6.4 billion.\n\nAnnual Cost: $4.7 billion\n\nImplementation Cost: $659 million\n\nDecember 1, 2015: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cPetroleum Refinery Sector Risk and Technology Review.\u201d This rule imposes new limits on emissions from smoking flares at refineries.\n\nAnnual Cost: $63.2 million\n\nImplementation Cost: $283 million\n\nDecember 2, 2016: Department of Agriculture, \u201cMandatory Inspection of Fish the Order Siluriformes and Products Derived from Such Fish.\u201d The rule establishes a mandatory inspection program for catfish that duplicates existing inspection requirements. This will cost taxpayers millions of dollars annually without enhancing the safety of catfish. The program will also limit import competition and increase the likelihood of retaliatory trade measures by foreign countries.\n\nAnnual Cost: $33,000\n\nDecember 14, 2016: Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cStandards for 2014, 2015, and 2016 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2017.\u201d The rule establishes the annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that apply to all motor vehicle gasoline and diesel produced or imported in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The renewable fuel standard distorts commodity production and prices, artificially raises the price of fuel and food, and has adverse environmental effects. The alleged climate benefit increasing biofuel use is dubious at best.\n\nAnnual Cost: $1.2 billion\n\nJanuary 6, 2016: Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \u201cMargin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants.\u201d This rule implements a Dodd\u2013Frank requirement that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission adopt initial and variation margin requirements for certain swap dealers and major swap participants.\n\nAnnual Cost: $1.1 billion\n\nJanuary 6, 2016: Department of Energy, \u201cEnergy Conservation Standards for Ceiling Fan Light Kits.\u201d The rule imposes more stringent energy conservation standards for ceiling light fan kits. Whether energy savings are worth the higher cost of a more efficient item is a decision that consumers and business owners can and should make for themselves. Taking away their ability to make that choice is not a benefit; it is a steep cost.\n\nAnnual Cost: $6 million\n\nJanuary 8, 2016: Department of Energy, \u201cEnergy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Refrigerated Bottled or Canned Beverage Vending Machines.\u201d The rule amends the energy conservation standards for Class A and Class B beverage vending machines.\n\nAnnual Cost: $1.8 million\n\nJanuary 15, 2016: Department of Energy, \u201cEnergy Conservation Standards for Residential Boilers.\u201d The rule adopts more stringent energy conservation standards for residential boilers, which will increase the costs of new appliances.\n\nAnnual Cost: $17.5 million\n\nJanuary 15, 2016: Department of Energy, \u201cEnergy Conservation Standards for Small, Large, and Very Large Air-Cooled Commercial Package Air Conditioning and Heating Equipment and Commercial Warm Air Furnaces.\u201d The rule amends the energy conservation standards for small, large, and very large air-cooled commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment and commercial warm air furnaces.\n\nAnnual Cost: $708 million\n\nAppendix C: Major Rules that Decrease Regulatory Burdens\n\nApril 20, 2015: Securities and Exchange Commission, \u201cAmendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions under the Securities Act (Regulation A).\u201d This rule implements provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act to exempt offerings of up to $50 million annually from registration requirements. While the new rule is less restrictive than the status quo, the SEC did adopt significant additional restrictions on small offerings which reduce the net gains.\n\nAnnual Savings: No cost-benefit analysis conducted.\n\nJune 16, 2015: Department of the Treasury, Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage and Uniform Glossary.\u201d This rule clarifies disclosure requirements for benefits and coverage for health plans. The rule increases some burdens, but also decreases regulatory duplication and increases flexibility.\n\nAnnual Savings: No cost-benefit analysis conducted.\n\nJuly 2, 2015: Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, \u201cImportation of Beef from a Region in Brazil.\u201d This rulemaking lifted a ban on beef imports from Brazil. The action is expected to lower prices for beef, as well as increase consumption of beef overall.\n\nAnnual Savings: $387.5 million\n\nJuly 7, 2015: Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Inspection Service, \u201cImportation of Beef from a Region in Argentina.\u201d This rulemaking lifted a ban on imported beef from certain areas of Argentina, which had been put in place to avoid the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. The U.S. Department of Agriculture found that fresh beef can now be safely imported. The winners are U.S. consumers, who are expected to gain $388 million through lower prices for, and greater availability of, beef.\n\nAnnual Savings: $191 million\n\nNovember 16, 2015: Securities and Exchange Commission, \u201cCrowdfunding.\u201d This rulemaking implements provisions of the JOBS Act to reduce barriers to crowdfunding\u2014raising large amounts of capital through small investments from large numbers of people, usually via the Internet. While the SEC rule is a step toward reducing impediments to this promising new source of funding for new businesses, the SEC did not open up the marketplace as significantly as many had hoped, limiting its impact.\n\nAnnual Savings: No cost-benefit analysis conducted.\n\nNovember 30, 2015: Department of the Treasury et al., \u201cMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities.\u201d This rulemaking establishes three exemptions to the swap rules established the same day in a separate proceeding.\n\nAnnual Savings: No cost-benefit analysis conducted.\n\nJanuary 19, 2016: Securities and Exchange Commission, \u201cSimplification of Disclosure Requirements for Emerging Growth Companies and Forward Incorporation by Reference on Form S\u20131 for Smaller Reporting Companies.\u201d The rule revises Forms S-1 and F-1 to permit emerging growth companies to omit financial information for certain historical periods and revises Form S-1 to permit forward incorporation by reference for smaller reporting companies.\n\nAnnual Savings: No cost-benefit analysis conducted.", "The Michael Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety is actively pushing an expansion of background checks for every firearm sale in Oregon, be that sale retail or private. They present the checks as the same kind of background checks required at Oregon gun shows \u201csince 2000,\u201d even though they admit the background checks at gun shows didn\u2019t really stamp out private sales.\n\nIn other words, Everytown is arguing that every gun sale in the state should be subject to the same background check that isn\u2019t working all that great at gun shows.\n\nTo accomplish passage of background checks, Everytown is using the same tactic they used in New Hampshire, where they conducted a study of online gun sales, then reported the number of guns that \u201cmay\u201d have been sold or \u201ccould\u201d have been sold, not the number that actually were. Then, they compared the number of guns advertised for sale with the number of guns actually sold at gun shows, which allows them to give Oregonians the sense that online gun sales are out of control.\n\nIn the process, they intimate that background checks at gun shows have not eliminated the private sales they were intended to erase.\n\nHere is how Everytown put it:\n\nAn estimated 25,000 unlicensed guns are posted for sale each year on just a handful of Oregon websites. This dwarfs the number of unlicensed sales conducted at gun shows, which have been subject to background checks in Oregon since 2000. Unlicensed sellers in the state post more gun ads online each week than they sell at gun shows in a full year.\n\nHere\u2019s the question: If background checks are such an integral and proven part of gun control, why are there still any private gun sales at Oregon gun shows? How is that possible?\n\nMoreover, why should the checks be forced on the rest of the state if they\u2019ve already failed in their stated purpose of ending private sales at gun shows?\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.

We cannot allow ourselves to be numbed or resigned when it comes to the deadly impact and easy access of firearms.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\nI went to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agency office a few months ago here in Chicago, they just completed a survey of the crime guns that were seized in the forty deadliest neighborhoods here in Chicago. Forty percent of those crime guns can be traced directly to gun shows in northwest Indiana. All you need to do is produce an ID there and you can fill up the trunk of your car with guns and ammo.\n\nThere is a considerable discrepancy between Durbin\u2019s claims and the Chicago Police Department\u2019s most recent report on guns. According to the CPD, a total of 60 percent of crime guns in Chicago \u201cwere first purchased outside of Illinois.\u201d And 19 percent of the crime guns confiscated \u201cbetween 2009 and 2013\u201d were traced back to Indiana. However, the CPD also reported that \u201cfour local dealers supplied nearly 20 percent of the guns recovered at Chicago crime scenes\u201d during this same time period, which means a larger percentage of guns found at Chicago crime scenes originated at Chicago area gun stores\u2013where background checks are required\u2013than originated in Indiana, where they are not.\n\nOn top of this, a University of Chicago Crime Lab survey published by the Chicago Tribune in August 2015, found that inmates in the Cook County jail preferred to get their guns on the streets from \u201cpersonal connections\u201d rather that outlets like guns shows and the internet. Inmates said some of them of have friends that maintain a Firearm Owners Identification Card, and those friends pass background checks to acquire guns, then sell them on the street. Others talked of buying guns from \u201ccorrupt cops\u201d who seize guns, then turn around and resell them as a way to make more money.\n\nThe bottom line\u2013No amount of gun control will stop determined criminals from getting guns, and the failure of Chicago\u2019s gun laws are just one more proof of this point.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Myers reported from Los Angeles.\n\nFollow Myers on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP", "A dispute has arisen in Syria over the disposition of a fifty-ton ammunition shipment from the United States, supposedly intended for Syrian Arab rebel groups. The munitions were instead taken by the Kurdish YPG militia, according to both Arab and Kurdish commanders, although the Pentagon officially insists the shipment reached its intended recipients.\n\nIt is an unwelcome note of confusion when Russia\u2019s bombing campaign and Iranian ground forces leave the fate of the Syrian rebellion in question and a major operation to take the ISIS capital of Raqqa is supposed to be in the works.\n\nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, Arab fighters are \u201cfired up\u201d by Washington\u2019s announcement that an operation to recapture Raqqa from the Islamic State will be \u201cthe next focus of the war.\u201d\n\nHowever, they insist there is no sign of the weapons the United States promised to deliver, because the Kurds took the major ammunition drop that was intended for them. More specifically, the supplies were claimed by a brand-new \u201cumbrella group\u201d called the Syrian Democratic Forces, which announced itself literally the day the ammo drop was made and is mostly comprised of Kurdish YPG forces, who outnumber Arab and Syrian fighters by 4 to 1.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian Democratic Forces\u00ad will decide which front the weapons will be given to, where the battle will be fought and who will get the weapons,\u201d declared one of the new umbrella group\u2019s commanders, Haki Kobane. He did not sound committed to the notion of a grand offensive against Raqqa, complaining that a mere fifty tons of ammunition \u201cis not enough to do anything,\u201d because his forces are \u201cfighting along a 700-kilometer front line.\u201d\n\nThe dispute over this ammo drop is problematic for several reasons, including Turkey\u2019s apprehension over Kurdish military strength and possible territorial ambitions. Also, the Syrian Arabs\u2019 have lingering doubts that the Kurds will fight hard to reclaim Sunni Arab territory such as Raqqa\u2014\u201da city the Kurds do not aspire to govern,\u201d as the Washington Post puts it.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the Turks fear the Kurdish YPG will pass weapons to the PKK insurgents Turkey is currently fighting, perhaps with the long-term goal of carving out a slice of Turkey to include in a Greater Kurdistan. The Syrian Arabs fear the Kurds are primarily interested in kicking ISIS out of their territory, lacking both the will and capability to mount a huge battle to evict ISIS from Raqqa.\n\nThe Syrian rebels do not think they can take Raqqa without more powerful weapons; one officer quoted by the Washington Post said they need boots, pointing out that his own feet were clad in plastic sandals. The Kurds have long complained they are being under-supplied, while they are simultaneously expected to handle the toughest ground fighting against ISIS.\n\nAll of these factions have reason to believe they would emerge from the bloody campaign to liberate Raqqa only to find the Syrian rebellion largely crushed, and Bashar Assad firmly in control of Damascus, at which point he would mostly likely take the keys to Raqqa. This is an outcome the Kurds appear to be significantly more comfortable with than the Turks or Syrian rebels.\n\nIf the planned Raqqa offensive disintegrates into factional rivalries, it would be another stunning blow for the Obama administration, which is already coping with the embarrassment of its much-touted $500 million plan to train an all-conquering, carefully vetted, U.S.-aligned Syrian rebel force. \u201cSyrian rebels balked at requirements that they abandon the fight against President Bashar al-Assad, and all but a dozen or so of the 130 who did receive the training were kidnapped by al-Qaeda, defected or deserted,\u201d says the Washington Post post-mortem of this failed strategy, tacitly acknowledging that the mysterious fate of the second wave of New Syrian Force fighters most likely did involve desertion, despite Pentagon denials last month.\n\nThe new plan involves arming select groups with agreeable ideology and proven fighting ability. The long-standing concern with plans to arm such groups is that American weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists. Losing control of a major ammo shipment would bolster those fears. Furthermore, the Washington Post notes that the Kurdish YPG has begun suffering criticism from human-rights groups for allegedly driving Arab villagers from their homes during its push across Syria, charges the Kurds deny.\n\nThe Pentagon, as mentioned above, is adamant that it did not lose control of the fifty-ton ammunition shipment.\n\n\u201cThis successful airdrop provided ammunition to Syrian groups whose leaders were appropriately vetted by the United States and have been fighting to remove ISIL from northern Syria,\u201d Defense Department spokeswoman Commander Elissa Smith told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement. \u201cThe airdrop includes small arms ammunition. Due to operational security we will not have any further details about the groups that received these supplies, their location, or the type of equipment in the airdrop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis airdrop supported Arab groups. We share the concern of our Turkish partners over the sensitivity of expanding Kurdish control into traditionally non-Kurdish areas in Syria,\u201d Smith added, directly addressing one of the major concerns over the fate of the shipment.\n\n\u201cWe are very confident in our ability to deliver cargo to its intended location,\u201d she asserted. \u201cWe have no indication that ISIL was able to intercept any of these supplies. This ammunition will enable anti-ISIL forces to continue their offensive against ISIL by disrupting their command and control and their freedom of maneuver.\u201d\n\nThis would seem to directly contradict what the Kurds and Syrians told the Washington Post, although it is noteworthy that delivering the supplies to their precise intended location does not mean it was received by the intended group, and while saying ISIS didn\u2019t get the ammunition is comforting, it does not mean the Kurdish YPG or their new 80 percent Kurdish \u201cumbrella group\u201d won\u2019t be the ones throwing those bullets at the Islamic State.", "The latest iPhone craze sweeping the New York City subways is not an app, but a disturbing trend where creepy men send pictures of their private parts to unsuspecting women via iPhone\u2019s AirDrop tool.\n\nThe New York Post tells the story of one such subway rider, Britta Carlson, 28, who received one of those pictures from an unknown contact July 27 while riding the uptown No. 6 train on her way to a concert.\n\n\u201ciPhone 1 would like to share a note with you,\u201d read the note sent at 6:51 p.m.\n\nShe saw that the message\u2019s subject was \u201cStraw\u201d and the sender was an anonymous stranger.\n\nWhen Carlson hit \u201cAccept,\u201d without knowing what the mysterious message was, she was horrified upon discovering its contents.\n\n\u201cIt was just a huge close-up picture of a disgusting penis,\u201d said Carlson, of Bushwick, Brooklyn. \u201cIt really felt like someone had actually just flashed me.\u201d\n\nCarlson said she received the photo from the stranger because the AirDrop tool\u2019s setting on her iPhone was customized to \u201cEveryone\u201d instead of her saved \u201cContacts Only.\u201d\n\nShe added that she used the \u201cEveryone\u201d setting to send photos from work.\n\n\u201cIt never even crossed my mind that someone may use it to send stuff like that,\u201d she admitted.\n\nAnother woman, Frankie Navisch, 35, of Harlem, also revealed that a man sent a photo of his genitalia through AirDrop titled \u201cEduardo\u2019s picture\u201d to her as she left a train at Penn Station.\n\n\u201cI wanted to punch him in the mouth for carelessly buckshotting genitalia to phones that could potentially be owned by children,\u201d Navisch said.\n\nAccording to Apple\u2019s website, the AirDrop tool allows iPhone users to transfer images and files to others nearby without taking up storage space.\n\nSex addiction therapist Brad Salzman told the Post that these incidents are becoming more common in the digital age.\n\n\u201cIn the past, flashers would have to go out in public in a trench coat and risk getting arrested,\u201d said Salzman.\n\nIn a similar incident that took place in July, a college student who received many unsolicited pictures of male genitalia via Tinder made a threat that if any guy sent her penis pictures, she would send them to his mother. When a guy challenged her on that, she followed through on her promise.", "Civil asset forfeiture is facing renewed pressure for reform from members in Congress concerned about its abuse, and the Justice Department appears to be pushing back\u2014hard.\n\nLast week, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein penned a lengthy panegyric to the controversial practice, calling it \u201ca powerful tool to make victims whole and prevent crime.\u201d\n\nThat is undeniable. But the question being asked in Congress and in virtually every state legislature is whether that tool has become too powerful, too stacked against innocent property owners, and whether some law enforcement officials have become too determined to get at the proceeds of crime, even at the expense of traditional functions like arresting and prosecuting criminals.\n\nTo date, 24 states have answered \u201cyes\u201d to one or all of these questions, and have reined in or eliminated the practice. Yet, judging from his piece, Rosenstein fervently disagrees with that assessment.\n\nThe Evidence\n\nRosenstein points to three high-profile cases in which civil forfeiture has recently been used to positive effect: the recovery of $3.9 billion of illicit proceeds related to Bernie Madoff\u2019s infamous Ponzi scheme; the forfeiture of $48 million from the criminal masterminds behind the notorious dark web drug emporium, the Silk Road; and the seizure of property from three brothers who defrauded Medicare to the tune of $110 million and then fled to Cuba.\n\nNobody can argue with any of these outcomes.\n\nBut these anecdotes are hardly representative of the norm in modern civil forfeiture cases. The tool was ramped up in the 1980s to go after the assets and ill-gotten gains of the worst-of-the-worst offenders\u2014the Madoffs and Silk Road operators of the world\u2014and the implication in Rosenstein\u2019s piece is that this class of offender remains the principal target of forfeiture operations.\n\nThe data, however, suggest otherwise. One analysis of seizures in the state of California found that, in 2013, the average value of seizures was $5,145.\n\nA review of seizures in Cook County, Illinois, found the median value of cash and property seized between 2012 and 2017 was $1,049.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the median value of seizures from 2009 to 2014 was a scant $141.\n\nKingpin money, this is not. Forfeiture\u2019s reach has extended well beyond its intended purpose.\n\nGuilty Until Proven Innocent\n\nAnother problem is that the current forfeiture process requires little\u2014if any\u2014actual evidence of criminality to justify a seizure.\n\nRosenstein insists that \u201cmoney or property cannot be seized without a lawful reason. The evidence must be sufficient to establish probable cause to believe a crime was committed.\u201d This \u201cevidence,\u201d though, often amounts to little more than an officer\u2019s belief that carrying any large sum of money is evidence in itself of wrongdoing.\n\nGeorge Reby, an insurance adjuster from New Jersey, had $22,000 in cash seized by a Tennessee cop as he was driving to a Nashville conference. Reby had proof that the money was legitimate, but the officer seized it anyway, stating in an affidavit that \u201ccommon people do not carry this much U.S. currency.\u201d\n\nMatt Lee had $2,400 seized by a Nevada sheriff\u2019s deputy during a cross-country drive to start a new job in California. The money was a gift from a loving father hoping to help his son get on his feet, but the deputy called it drug money and seized it despite uncovering no evidence of illicit behavior.\n\nLee and Reby were obviously innocent, but only after considerable effort and publicity did they manage to get their money returned. Many are not so lucky.\n\nIn his piece, Rosenstein points out that 80 percent of seizures are never challenged, a fact he interprets as a clear sign that \u201cmost cases are indisputable.\u201d\n\nBut there is another potential explanation. Civil forfeiture laws offer scant due process protections. Property owners contesting a seizure must hire an attorney out of pocket, or navigate a tortuous legal landscape alone, and the administrative process has many traps for the unwary that can result in property owners inadvertently waiving their rights to contest a forfeiture.\n\nIn either case, they face long odds: Federal forfeiture laws place the burden on the property owners to prove, in essence, their own innocence. When the value of what is seized is less than the cost of an attorney, a rational property owner\u2014even an entirely innocent one\u2014may have little choice but to drop the matter.\n\nIn fairness, the majority of cash seizures likely can be tied to drug offenses or other crimes. As Rosenstein points out, \u201cwhen the police find $100,000 in shrink-wrapped $20 bills hidden in a suitcase, usually there is no innocent explanation.\u201d\n\nThat is true. Still, the question must be asked, what do law enforcement officials do after they discover this sum of money? Do they make arrests? Do they seek to prosecute offenders? The answer to these questions is frequently \u201cno.\u201d\n\nExtortion of the Innocent\n\nThis year, a scathing Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General report revealed that poor data collection and analysis made it impossible to say conclusively whether seizures \u201cbenefit law enforcement efforts, such as advancing criminal investigations.\u201d\n\nThis same report reviewed 100 cash seizures made by the Drug Enforcement Administration, finding that only 44 could be tied to an arrest, a prosecution, or the initiation or advancement of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Washington Post has previously reported that, from 2001 through 2014, law enforcement officials nationwide seized more than $2.5 billion in cash from 62,000 people in a series of roadside, warrantless seizures that resulted in no indictments.\n\nIn 2010, two drug task force officers working a strip of highway in rural Tennessee pulled over a refrigerated truck, suspecting it was being used to transport drug money.\n\nAccording to dashboard video, one officer told the driver, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not asking you if you have knowledge about it, and I won\u2019t ask you if you have knowledge about it. You understand me? It\u2019s not my job. \u2026 All I\u2019m asking you is, where\u2019s the money?\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, the driver revealed the location of $500,000 in shrink-wrapped bills, signed a waiver disclaiming any interest in the currency, and was allowed to go free.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a sheriff was indicted on bribery and extortion charges stemming from a 2014 traffic stop. The sheriff discovered $10,000 in cash and evidence of drug dealing in the car, and initially arrested the driver on charges of felony possession of drug proceeds. But then the sheriff made the driver an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse: to let him go if he waived his rights to the money.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department got $10,000 richer, and the drug dealer was released, only to be convicted later (thankfully) in Missouri of methamphetamine distribution.\n\nSurely, this is not the sort of police work the Department of Justice wishes to condone or incentivize.\n\nIn his piece, Rosenstein writes of the need to enhance accountability within the department and provide additional \u201ctraining on the ethics and legal requirements of forfeiture.\u201d These are welcome developments, but preventing abusive and unjustifiable forfeiture practices will require more significant steps.\n\nReform Starts in Congress\n\nCongress should end the forfeiture financial incentive, which allows agencies to retain the proceeds of successful forfeitures, and spend it with little accountability. This encourages profiteering, risks agencies becoming dependent on revenue from seizures, and can so warp department priorities that cash seizures displace arrests and prosecution, and become ends in themselves.\n\nWe can all agree that law enforcement officers should be generously funded, but that funding should come through the appropriate constitutional channel: the legislature.\n\nAt the very least, so long as law enforcement authorities are permitted to keep some or all of these funds, there should be much greater transparency about how much is seized and the uses to which those funds are put.\n\nCongress must also enhance the due process protections available to innocent property owners, beginning with the standard of proof in forfeiture cases. Rosenstein insists that the normal civil standard, a preponderance of the evidence, is more than sufficient in these cases.\n\nWith all due respect, this is simply not the case. Going back to 1886, the Supreme Court has recognized that forfeiture is quasi-criminal in nature. With this in mind, and given that someone\u2019s home or life\u2019s savings may be at stake, the normal civil standard is too low.\n\nCongress should elevate the standard to clear and convincing evidence, and require that the government prove not only that the assets to be seized are tied to a crime, but that an owner knew about or turned a blind eye toward the illegal conduct.\n\nThese are just two of nine critical reforms to asset forfeiture laws that The Heritage Foundation has proposed. Many of them have been adopted in two bills now before Congress\u2014the FAIR Act and the DUE PROCESS Act.\n\nIn the final analysis, Rosenstein\u2019s article aims to buttress the status quo by charging that reforms will make it impossible to go after the Bernie Madoffs, the Silk Roads, and the absconders from justice.\n\nIn reality, for two centuries civil forfeiture laws allowed the government to seize assets from criminals beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.\n\nIn the 1980s, Congress ramped up forfeiture for the express purpose of targeting the worst-of-the-worst offenders. The reforms now before Congress are not designed to inhibit that government action\u2014they are designed to get back to a forfeiture system that focuses on them, in a way that preserves forfeiture\u2019s moral credibility.\n\nThat narrow, noble goal is one Americans can get behind.", "Members of Congress brought renewed attention to a legislative effort to halt efforts by the Department of Justice to restart one of the most controversial civil-forfeiture practices, so-called \u201cadoptive\u201d forfeitures.\n\nThe practice, part of the equitable sharing program, allows state and local law enforcement to seize property in their jurisdictions and then hand it over to federal agencies to conduct the forfeiture. In return, the original seizing agency then receives up to 80 percent of the proceeds if the forfeiture is successful.\n\nIn 2015, the Justice Department essentially halted this type of forfeiture amid growing concerns that it gave police and sheriffs a financial incentive to circumvent state laws when federal law made it easier to seize assets. Some state laws are more protective of property rights and more restrictive in how forfeiture funds can be raised and spent than federal law.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s decision was hailed by reform advocates, but in July, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a directive reinstating adoptions.\n\nThat move prompted pushback from lawmakers. Led by Reps. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Justin Amash, R-Mich., a bipartisan group of House members sought to put a stop to Sessions\u2019 actions by blocking funding for the program.\n\nIn September, the House unanimously passed three amendments to the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, to cut off funding for the implementation of Sessions\u2019 directive.\n\nHouse and Senate negotiators are now working to develop a final funding package that both chambers can pass and send to the president. With those negotiations under way, Walberg and a bipartisan group of 27 other representatives signed a letter encouraging Reps. John Culberson, R-Texas, and Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, to include the amendments\u2019 language in the final bill.\n\n\u201cThese amendments, which were adopted by voice vote, were championed by a diverse group of lawmakers and supported by a broad coalition of organizations, including the American Conservative Union, the Institute for Justice, the NAACP, and the ACLU,\u201d the group noted in the letter.\n\nThis broad, bipartisan support for reining in civil forfeiture is reflected in the population at large. One recent poll found that 84 percent of Americans oppose forfeiture of property without a criminal conviction.\n\nThis effort to use the appropriations process to halt the expansion of civil forfeiture is a reminder that, in our constitutional system, the power of the purse rests with Congress.\n\nVesting the legislature with control over the treasury was no accident of constitutional design. The Framers intended it to be an essential mechanism for holding the government accountable to the people through their elected representatives.\n\nCivil forfeiture has been roundly criticized for undercutting this basic premise of good government. Revenues generated through forfeiture may be spent with virtually no oversight. Funds distributed to local or state agencies via the equitable sharing program are similarly beyond the reach of state or local lawmakers.\n\nPerhaps this lack of accountability explains how funds supposedly reserved for \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d wind up getting spent on margarita machines, training trips to Hawaii, and chrome accents for Harley Davidson motorcycles.\n\nAs one of our Founding Fathers, George Mason, put it, \u201cWhen the same man, or set of men, holds the sword and the purse, there is an end of liberty.\u201d\n\nCivil forfeiture may not quite be the end of liberty, but it has certainly blurred the boundary between the men who wield the government\u2019s sword and those who manage its purse. Innocent property owners have paid the price.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the last three years, 25 states and the District of Columbia have reined in or eliminated civil forfeiture. Many have restricted or outright prohibited their law enforcement agencies from raising and spending forfeiture revenues.\n\nAdoptive forfeitures, and the entire equitable sharing program, undercut these positive developments and run counter to the principle of federalism by undermining state efforts to ensure greater fairness, accountability, and transparency to forfeiture process.\n\nThroughout American history, Congress has used its appropriations authority to advance key policy priorities, as well as to restrain executive agencies. For example, in 2014, Congress stopped funds from being used to bring Guantanamo detainees to the United States.\n\nIn that same spirit, Congress should now act to bolster state civil forfeiture reforms by defunding the adoptive forfeiture directive. That move would be a modest, but significant, development, and would send a clear signal that Congress has little appetite for the expansion of civil forfeiture, especially when it overrides sensible state reform efforts.\n\nIt may even help to set the stage for more expansive action on civil forfeiture.\n\nTo that end, The Heritage Foundation has developed nine critical civil forfeiture reforms, including ending the forfeiture financial incentive and the equitable sharing program. Many of these proposals have been incorporated into two pieces of legislation now before Congress\u2014the FAIR Act and the DUE PROCESS Act.\n\nNow is the time to begin bringing greater oversight, accountability, and transparency to civil forfeiture. Defunding adoptive forfeitures is a good first step.", "Amendment XXV: Presidential Succession, Vice Presidency, Incapacity to Perform Duties of Office Essays\n\nSection 1\n\nIn case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.\n\nSection 2\n\nWhenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\n\nSection 3\n\nWhenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.\n\nSection 4\n\nWhenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\n\nThereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.

Amendment V\n\nArticle Thirty-nine of the Magna Carta (1215) proclaimed that \"no free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go or send against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.\" This \"law of the land\" requirement, which is often called the principle of legality, prohibited unilateral, arbitrary action by the king against certain protected private interests.\n\nThe phrase \"due process of law\" made its first appearance in a statute of 1354 concerning court procedures. \"Due process of law\" meant that judgments could only issue when the defendant was personally given the opportunity to appear in court pursuant to an appropriate writ (i.e., was served process). The phrase retained this technical meaning in English law into the eighteenth century.\n\nAt the time of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, at least eight state constitutions contained clauses restraining government from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property except pursuant to the law of the land. The Fifth Amendment, which otherwise tracked the form of these state provisions, used the phrase \"due process of law\" instead of \"law of the land.\" The reasons for this change in terminology are uncertain, but it is likely that the Founding generation was misled by some seventeenth-century statements of Sir Edward Coke (familiar to virtually all the Founders), who had declared\u2014wrongly, in the judgment of modern historians\u2014that the phrases \"law of the land\" and \"due process of law\" were essentially equivalent. Accordingly, the constitutional meaning of \"due process of law\" almost certainly refers to the principle of legality rather than to pleading technicalities.\n\nUntil very close to the time of the Framing, the judicial power was generally viewed as an aspect of executive power. Thus, the essence of the eighteenth-century American understanding of the phrase \"without due process of law\" meant something like \"executive or judicial action taken without lawful authorization and/or not in accordance with traditional forms of justice.\" The Supreme Court extended the principle to Congress in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. (1856). There, the Court determined that the Due Process Clause limited the power of Congress to authorize novel forms of adjudication. The case involved a constitutional challenge to a statutory procedure in which the government collected deficiencies from tax collectors without first having a court determine whether the tax collector really owed the money to the government. The Court found that the clause \"is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the government, and cannot be so construed as to leave congress free to make any process \u2018due process of law,' by its mere will.\" In order to determine whether legislatively prescribed forms of adjudication violated due process of law, the Court looked to \"those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England.\" The Court found a long tradition in English and American law of auditing tax collectors without prior hearings and accordingly upheld the practice.\n\nThe Due Process Clause requires that deprivations of \"life, liberty, or property\" be accompanied by due process of law. The deprivation of other interests that do not fall within this enumeration need not be accompanied by due process of law. When the Due Process Clause was ratified in 1791, the meaning of \"liberty\" as a personal right was clear. Sir William Blackstone, whose influence on the Founding generation was enormous, wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that the right to liberty meant \"the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or removing one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct; without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law.\" That definition excludes such matters as bodily integrity. Those interests, however, were encompassed by Blackstone's definition of life, which referred to an array of rights lumped together under the general heading of personal security: \"a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation.\" The term \"property\" in 1791 was more ambiguous. It could have referred to land, to land plus chattels, to anything of exchangeable value, or (what seems most likely) to whatever interests common-law courts would have recognized as property entitled to legal protection. None of these understandings would include as property future enjoyment of government benefits, such as jobs or licenses. The law sharply distinguished between property rights and mere privileges that the government could continue or terminate at its pleasure.\n\nThe eighteenth-century lawyer trying to define the phrase \"life, liberty, or property\" would have had to face a very sticky problem that could not be answered by reference to Blackstone, tradition, or any other authoritative source of meaning: Do these terms draw their meaning from federal law, state law, or both? Does the Constitution contain its own internal definitions of those terms, so that the Constitution itself determines whether a particular interest is property? Are they defined by reference to the laws of the states, so that a particular interest might be constitutional \"property\" in Pennsylvania but not in New York? Or must the universe of constitutionally protected interests be determined by some combination of federal and state law?\n\nPerhaps the best answer, though it is impossible to prove this claim decisively, is that federal law sets the outer boundaries of \"life, liberty, and property\" and state law fixes the details. Surely the Constitution does not itself determine whether a particular estate in land, such as a surface estate on mining land, is or is not \"property\" for purposes of the Due Process Clause; either answer is permissible and, accordingly, can vary from one jurisdiction to another. But if a state decided that land was henceforth no longer to be considered \"property,\" that would pass the boundaries of acceptability. Federal law thus establishes for each term a \"core\" of meaning that no jurisdiction can alter, but beyond that core, governments are free to expand or contract the range of constitutionally protected interests.\n\nModern doctrine has significantly modified the original understanding of how one determines compliance with \"due process of law.\" Instead of reference to traditionally accepted procedural forms, contemporary law, dating back a century, has judged the adequacy of procedures by a m\u00e9lange of practical factors that resist easy reduction. As Justice Frankfurter summarized matters in a famous concurring opinion in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath in 1951: \"\u2018[D]ue process' is compounded of history, reason, the past course of decisions, and stout confidence in the strength of the democratic faith which we profess....It is a delicate process of judgment by those whom the Constitution entrusted with the unfolding of the process.\"\n\nIn Matthews v. Eldridge (1976), the Court attempted to clarify its case law by requiring consideration of\n\nfirst, the [significance of the] private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the [weight of the] Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\n\nThis balancing-of-factors approach is universally decried as unpredictable. Many observers also object to the Court's optimistic goal of accurate decision-making, and there is considerable disagreement about which other possible goals of procedure should be factored into the mix.\n\nIn addition, one of the trickiest questions in modern law concerns the timing of procedures: which procedures (if any) must come before the government deprives people of protected interests? The law in this area remains unsettled in many important respects and defies simple description.\n\nThe most dramatic transformations in modern due process have concerned the range of interests encompassed by the phrase \"life, liberty, or property.\" As late as 1950, the original meaning still largely held sway, though Blackstone's broad understanding of \"life\" mysteriously vanished in favor of a much narrower meaning. No doubt this development, which was never expressly acknowledged, put pressure on the other terms in the enumeration to include such worthy interests as physical integrity and reputation. More importantly, the rise of the post-New Deal administrative state vastly expanded the range of circumstances under which official action could affect people's lives, and the concomitant expansion of government benefits, jobs, and licenses raised the stakes of excluding such interests from procedural protection. By the early 1960s, a majority of the Court was prepared to treat the phrase \"life, liberty, or property\" as a convenient shorthand for \"any interest whose loss would be grievous\" rather than as a list of three distinct terms with distinct, ascertainable meanings\u2014a development that some commentators half-jokingly described as \"lifelibertyproperty.\" On this new understanding, government benefits could easily constitute interests whose loss would be grievous.\n\nIn 1970, the Court formalized this understanding in Goldberg v. Kelly, where the State of New York, in its argument to the Supreme Court concerning the need for elaborate pretermination hearings prior to termination of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Act, did not even argue that expected future receipt of AFDC benefits was not a constitutionally protected interest. Subsequent cases quickly extended constitutional protection to such interests as government licenses and reputation.\n\nIn 1972, the Supreme Court established the framework of modern law in Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth. That case reestablished some differentiations among the three protected interests. The Court held that \"liberty\" and \"property\" were distinct terms with ascertainable meanings, though \"life\" continues to be conspicuously absent from modern recitations of the range of protected interests. The Court explicitly stated, however, that these terms would not be construed in accordance with their original meaning, but would have to be construed to include the extended range of interests recognized in prior case law, including government benefits.\n\nAccordingly, the Court has expanded the definition of the term \"liberty,\" beginning with Meyer v. State of Nebraska (1923), in which it declared that \"liberty\" includes \"not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized...as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\" It is true that the term has been held not to include (at least under some circumstances) a right to government employment, an interest in reputation, or many interests claimed by prisoners. The government is free, however, to construct these excluded interests to be constitutionally protected through statutes and regulations by specifying a clear causal connection between satisfaction of criteria of eligibility and receipt of a benefit, but they are not automatically protected as a matter of constitutional command. Nonetheless, the Court's extraordinary expansion of the concept of \"liberty\" reached its apogee in the famous (some critics say infamous) declaration by Justice Anthony Kennedy: \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\" Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992).\n\nIt is state law today that primarily defines the term \"property.\" Interests within the traditional understanding of property are generally still considered to be property. Interests beyond the traditional understanding, such as government benefits and licenses, are constitutionally protected if statutory or regulatory provisions draw a clear causal line from the satisfaction of eligibility criteria to the receipt of benefits. The case law distinguishes the substance of the created interest from the procedures for its termination. The latter is what the Due Process Clause protects. Within the zone beyond the constitutional core of \"liberty\" and \"property,\" government can determine which substantive interests shall receive due-process protection, but once that substantive decision is made, the constitutional law of due process assesses the adequacy of the procedures. In other words, the government may not make acceptance of \"unconstitutional\" termination procedures a condition of receiving government benefits.\n\nIf an interest does not fall within the meaning of the phrase \"life, liberty, or property,\" the Due Process Clause does not mandate any particular procedures for its deprivation. Other sources of law, whether constitutional or statutory, may well do so, but the Due Process Clause is, so to speak, \"turned off.\" There are several other \"on-off switches\" that determine the applicability of the Due Process Clause.\n\nFirst, the clause only applies to government action; private entities are not bound by the Fifth Amendment or, indeed, by anything in the Constitution except the Thirteenth Amendment. This can pose difficult questions when the acting entity is nominally private but is involved in some fashion with the government. See \"State Action\" in the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1. Second, modern law holds that the word \"deprived\" in the Due Process Clause means an intentional (or, at a minimum, a reckless) taking of a protected interest. Losses inflicted by government negligence do not implicate the Due Process Clause.\n\nThird, and most importantly, administrative agencies are responsible for the vast bulk of governmental actions that work deprivations of interests within the compass of the Due Process Clause. Those agencies engage in two forms of official action: rule-making, which strongly resembles in form and function the promulgation of a statute by the legislature, and adjudication, which strongly resembles in form and function the decision of a case by a court. The Due Process Clause has never been understood to impose procedural requirements on legislatures (though it does, under modern understandings, regulate the content of legislation that authorizes executive or judicial procedures). For almost a century, courts have held that agency rule-making shares in this legislative immunity from due-process analysis; agency rule-making is subject to no constitutional procedural requirements. Agency adjudication, however, is subject to due-process analysis, but agencies do not stand in the same shoes as courts. Procedures that would be obviously inadequate in judicial proceedings are considered constitutionally adequate for agency adjudication. The size of the gap is uncertain, which typifies the complexity of the modern law of procedural due process.\n\nGary Lawson Abraham & Lillian Benton Scholar Professor of Law Boston University School of Law", "Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShare Takings Clause\n\n...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. Amendment V\n\nThe drafter of this clause, James Madison, opined: \"A Government is instituted to protect property of every sort...This being the end of government, that alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own.\" Against the proposition that the singular purpose of our government is the protection of property, there is the curiosity that the original Constitution scarcely mentions the term. Although at least two states demanded every other provision that we know today as the Bill of Rights, not one requested the Takings Clause. What explains the anomaly?\n\nThe beginning of an answer can be found in Alexander Hamilton's observation that \"the true protection of men's rights are to be found not among old parchments, or musty records. They are written...in the whole volume of human nature...and can never be erased or obscured.\" Alexander Hamilton was, of course, referring to the natural law, which is one of the doctrinal foundations of the United States set out in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs a matter of original understanding, the American Founders viewed the natural right to acquire or possess property as embedded in the common law, which they regarded as the natural law applied to specific facts. Thus, the Framers thought that there was little need to create a \"parchment protection\" against the states, which were, after all, carrying on the common-law tradition. Many early colonial and state charters had explicitly protected \"the means of acquiring and possessing property\" as part of the common-law rights of Englishmen brought over at the time of the first settlements. Nonetheless, Madison apparently believed that the federal government, which, of course, had no long-standing tradition of supporting property rights, should be explicitly restricted to follow the common-law form. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the clause would be judicially applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chicago, Burlington & Quincey Railroad Co. (1897).\n\nProperty is not, however, entirely a natural right. The Founders understood that it would need to be further defined in statute. Particular rights of sale or use might well vary from place to place. For example, Thomas Jefferson introduced legislation in Virginia that would abolish landed estates (so-called entails) that were inheritable only through limited bloodlines. Similar restrictions were present in the common law through the rule against perpetuities, which prevents an owner from leaving property with ultimate ownership uncertain for too long a period after his death.\n\nBecause the Fifth Amendment places a restriction on the ability and manner of taking property by the federal government, this begs a central question: what is the source of the federal government's power of eminent domain in the first place? The states clearly had that power through their longstanding common-law tradition. How did the new federal government come to possess it as well? Two answers have been proposed. The first suggests that the power to take property is inherent in any sovereign. Jones v. United States (1883); Mississippi & Rum River Boom Co. v. Patterson (1878). Although Hugo Grotius, who coined the phrase \"eminent domain\" in 1625, disagreed, a sovereign in certain very limited\u2014usually war-time\u2014situations, has been allowed to take property without the obligation to compensate. In another rare circumstance, where property is physically taken, if the taking results in no net loss to the owner, compensation is not due. Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington (2003). Putting these rarities aside, it is frequently said that the very institution of the federal government brings with it the power of eminent domain.\n\nA second answer is that the federal power of eminent domain resides in, and is limited by, the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18), or by Congress's implied powers as confirmed by the Necessary and Proper Clause. McCulloch v. Maryland (1819); United States v. Gettysburg Electric Railway Co. (1896). Under this perspective, Congress may exercise the power of eminent domain only in order to effectuate one of its delegated powers. Similarly, the executive is limited to property takings allowable only under Article II executive powers, but they are far more restricted. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). Inasmuch as James Madison came to support and propose a Bill of Rights because he realized the range of congressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause, and inasmuch as the Takings Clause is primarily his offering, such a reading has historical credence.\n\nWhat changes to the definition of property, then, can the federal government\u2014and since incorporation of the Fifth Amendment, a state or local government\u2014legislate without offending the natural right to property that underlies the common law? Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes initially opined that regulation must not go \"too far\": a judicial limit, but not a very formidable one. Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon (1922). Worse, the test actually looked at the wrong question. It focused on whether the regulation diminished the value of the property, rather than asking whether the regulation actually was consistent with common-law limitations on the use of property. The confusion between restrictions on use and diminution of value continues to affect the judicial interpretation of the clause.\n\nSo what limits have the modern cases placed on the regulation of property? In other words, what is \"too far\"? The Supreme Court easily determined that a regulation that authorizes the physical occupation of property was a taking. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. (1982). This categorical protection of the right to exclude emerged from the ancient protection against trespass. But Loretto's significance was not great as a practical matter, because few regulations have the brazenness, short of formal condemnation, to authorize third parties to station themselves on other's property. Occasionally, regulation comes close to outright physical occupation, by conditioning the grant of a governmental permit upon some forfeiture of a property interest. For example, one homeowner was told that he could expand his home, but only if he provided a beach easement to the public. Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987). Another was told that she could enlarge a retail plumbing store if she set aside property for a bike path. Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994).\n\nIn these cases, the Court has held that the Takings Clause prohibits the regulating agencies from using the permit process to leverage their governmental power to achieve what they wish without cost. To survive review, regulatory conditions must \"substantially advance\" a legitimate governmental interest and be reasonably \"proportionate\" to the external effects likely to be caused by the property owner's proposal. In Nollan, the landowner was freed of the beach-easement requirement because it was unnecessary to the government's stated purposes. In Dolan, the store owner did not have to facilitate the bike path, because, however desirable that might be, the need for it was not caused by the activity being regulated (the expansion of a plumbing store).\n\nThe Court has also applied the Takings Clause to invalidate regulations that deprive property of all of its economic use. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council (1992). This, too, is a taking unless the regulation parallels the limitations in the background principles of the state's law of property and nuisance. In Lucas, the desired property use was for residential construction, and the regulating state could not show that the common-law nuisance principles prohibited that use of the property.\n\nThe significance of the common-law/natural-right backdrop of property continues to shape constitutional doctrine. But what happens if modern regulation does not just mimic the common law but imposes far greater restrictions, based perhaps on modern environmental considerations? Recent judicial pronouncements indicate that the courts would regard at least a certain amount of environmental restriction as a reasonable extension of the common-law principle. But if one knowingly purchases land in a jurisdiction with an expansive environmental regime, the landowner is not automatically precluded from a takings claim. Rather, that knowledge is only one additional factor for the court to consider in judging whether the regulation can justifiably be considered a taking. Palazzolo v. Rhode Island (2001).\n\nOther factual matters do play a significant role in keeping most takings cases out of court. State administrative and judicial determinations regarding the final application of regulations to individual parcels and the availability of compensation to owners are prolonged and expensive. Until these processes are completed, a \"ripeness doctrine\" prevents owners from seeking relief in federal court. Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank (1985). The Court has occasionally expressed frustration with the bureaucratic games that result in protracted litigation, Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd. (1999), but most often property owners are turned away from the courts and told to keep working through the prescribed processes.\n\nThe most difficult Takings Clause cases are the most common ones. In these, the regulation has not physically invaded or precipitated a total loss, or even been employed to gain undue leverage. Rather, regulation reduces, often significantly but not totally, the economic prospects for property, and an owner asks to be compensated. The governing case here remains Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York (1978). In Penn Central, which dealt with an ordinance that preserved a historic landmark by imposing a large loss on the property owner by forbidding construction of an office tower above it, the Court admitted that the takings issue was \"a problem of considerable difficulty.\" \"There was,\" said the Court, \"no \u2018set formula' for determining when \u2018justice and fairness' require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.\" The Court admitted that in the typical case it would apply an ad hoc balancing test that would consider (1) the economic impact on the property owner, (2) the extent to which the regulation interfered with investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character or extent of the government action.\n\nIn the weighing of these factors, most property owners have lost their claims for compensation. A few have prevailed by recharacterizing the portion taken as a complete deprivation of a part, rather than a partial deprivation of a whole. The Court has said that, where there is a regulation that is terminated after a court has concluded that it constituted a taking, the owner's deprivation during the temporary period in which the regulation was effective is compensable. First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles (1987). However, whether a planned moratorium (even if it lasts for years) constitutes a taking must be determined by using the Penn Central multifactor test. Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (2002).\n\nDespite the frustration and cost of litigation of enforcing the Takings Clause, property owners remain indefatigable, and they are especially so when they perceive regulation to exceed a reasonable scope and invade that which may fairly be thought to be one of the natural rights of ownership. The ultimate purpose of the Takings Clause was well described by the Court more than forty years ago as \"designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\" Armstrong v. United States (1960). That is the central principle that prompted the Framers to add the Takings Clause to the Bill of Rights.\n\n[Editors' Note: In Kelo v. City of New London (2005) the city of New London planned to use eminent domain to acquire property for a redevelopment project that would replace existing private homes in good condition with private office space and parking lots. The property owners argued that the taking was not \"for [a] public use,\" and thus violated the Fifth Amendment. In a 5\u20134 opinion, the Court upheld the taking, holding that where a government presents a \"comprehensive development plan\" with \"public benefits\" that are not merely \"incidental or pretextual,\" the Court will apply a deferential, rational-basis\u2013like standard to determine whether the asserted public benefit of the taking satisfies the public use requirement. In dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued that taking of a private property for the benefit of another private party does not constitute public use, unless there is a direct public benefit, such as the elimination of a blighted area.]\n\nDouglas W.

Amendment XXVI\n\nThe Vietnam War provoked many draft-age youngsters and like-minded adults to proclaim, \"If eighteen-to-twenty-year-olds are old enough to die for their country, they're old enough to vote.\" That slogan is commonly cited as the impetus for the Twenty-sixth Amendment. The truth is somewhat less colorful. The amendment was crafted primarily to overturn the holding of a fractured Supreme Court in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970). That case had invalidated an attempt by Congress to regulate voting age in state and local elections. Essentially, the Twenty-sixth Amendment did what Congress could not do.\n\nEarlier in 1970, Congress had amended the Voting Rights Act of 1965, lowering the minimum voting age to eighteen in all federal, state, and local elections. When the revised law was challenged, primarily on federalism grounds, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote an opinion reflecting the position of two separate five-Justice majorities. One contingent agreed with Black that Congress could establish a minimum voting age for federal elections, but found contrary to Black that Congress could also exercise that power over state and local elections. A different four Justices joined Black in restricting Congress's power over state and local elections, but would have restricted its power over federal elections as well. Thus, Black's opinion became the Court's holding: Congress had the authority to extend the vote to eighteen-year-olds in federal elections but not in state or local contests.\n\nAfter Oregon v. Mitchell, states unwilling to set their minimum voting age at eighteen would have been required to maintain separate voting systems for federal and nonfederal elections. To avoid that complication and expense, the states opted for national uniformity and ratified the Twenty-sixth Amendment in record time\u2014a mere 107 days after it was proposed by Congress.\n\nAlmost immediately, the courts had to resolve issues peripheral to the new amendment. For example, did the right to vote for a candidate include eligibility to sign and vote for initiative petitions? In Colorado Project-Common Cause v. Anderson (1972), a state court found that enactment of the Twenty-sixth Amendment entailed participation by young voters in the entire political process\u2014initiatives included.\n\nCould states restrict voting by minors by denying them residency at schools or other places away from their parents? In Jolicoeur v. Mihaly (1971), the California Supreme Court found that denying minors voting residence where they actually lived\u2014whether at school or elsewhere\u2014constituted a violation of the Twenty-sixth Amendment; the amendment was held to have emancipated minors for all purposes related to voting. In the same vein, a New Jersey court added that the Twenty-sixth Amendment secured the rights of bona fide campus residents to register in the counties where their campuses were located. Worden v. Mercer County Board of Elections (1972).\n\nOn the other hand, a state constitution could, without offending the Twenty-sixth Amendment, institute twenty-one as the minimum age for holding elective public office. Opatz v. City of St. Cloud (1972). And the amendment does not mandate that persons under twenty-one years old be seated as jurors under state law. Johnson v. State (1972); Commonwealth v. Cobbs (1973); State ex rel. McNary v. Stussie (1974).", "Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShare Congressional Compensation\n\nNo law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened. Amendment XXVII\n\nOn June 8, 1789, James Madison proposed the Congressional Compensation Amendment as one of many that he presented to the House of Representatives that day. After debate, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved the proposed amendment and forwarded it and eleven others to the states. Only six states ratified it, however, and thus it did not become part of the Bill of Rights. The proposed amendment languished for almost two hundred years before becoming the object of a successful ratification campaign in the 1980s, ultimately resulting in its formal acceptance by Congress as the Twenty-seventh Amendment on May 20, 1992.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention, the Framers heatedly debated the question of whether individual states or the new national government would compensate elected representatives. The Compensation Clause of Article I, Section 6, was the result, providing that the central government would pay the representatives from the federal treasury as established by federal law.\n\nThe Anti-Federalists and others at state ratifying conventions found this compensation arrangement deeply worrisome; because the Members of Congress enacted the very law that set their salary, there was no check on Congress's ability to enrich itself. It was a classic case of the danger of self-dealing corruption. Madison responded to that criticism with the proposed Compensation Amendment, which would prevent representatives from granting themselves a pay raise that would take effect during the term in which they sat. Instead, Congress would only be able to pass the pay raise prospectively and would thereby face the electorate before it could take effect. Madison believed the amendment was necessary because of the \"seeming impropriety in leaving any set of men without controul to put their hand into the public coffers, to take out money to put in their pockets.\"\n\nThe issue of congressional compensation was the subject of periodic legislation and attendant political maneuvering in succeeding years. Particularly unpopular with the electorate was the notorious \"Salary Grab\" Act of 1873, which not only granted a pay raise to legislators but also made it retroactive. One of the Ohio General Assembly's responses to the act was ratification of the dormant Compensation Amendment, thus becoming the seventh state to do so, eighty-four years after Maryland, which was the first state to ratify.\n\nOver a century later, the amendment became the object of a grassroots ratification campaign initiated by a college undergraduate who had authored a term paper on the subject in 1982. Despite widespread doubt about the propriety of actually adopting the long-dormant amendment should it ever be fully ratified, the ratification campaign gathered momentum. On May 7, 1992, Michigan became the thirty-eighth state to ratify the Compensation Amendment, completing the process initiated over two hundred years earlier by the First Congress in 1789.\n\nThe unique history of the Compensation Amendment raised initial questions about the validity of its ratification. In Coleman v. Miller (1939), the Supreme Court declared that disputes about ratification procedures and the time within which an amendment could be ratified were political questions assigned to the province of the legislative branch under Article V of the Constitution and, therefore, not subject to adjudication by the federal courts. Coleman seemed to envision some sort of formal congressional review of the constitutional validity of a fully ratified amendment prior to its official addition to the Constitution. Despite initial comments about formal review by rather stunned federal legislators following Michigan's ratifying vote on May 7, 1992, Congress, sensing the public mood, scheduled no formal hearings on the Compensation Amendment. On May 18, 1992, the National Archivist certified the amendment. Two days later, overwhelming majorities in both chambers of Congress confirmed the Twenty-seventh Amendment.\n\nThe first, and thus far, only, case to explore the scope of the amendment's compensation limitation was Schaffer v. Clinton (2001) where four plaintiffs challenged the now-traditional annual cost-of-living pay increases to legislators. The district court interpreted Flast v. Cohen (1968) to limit general taxpayer standing to challenges under the Establishment Clause only (and thereby refusing to treat the Twenty-seventh Amendment as a comparable explicit restriction on spending). The court denied standing to three of the plaintiffs, who came to the court as taxpayers. However, the district court reached the merits for the remaining plaintiff, Congressman Bob Schaffer, whose salary was increased under the statute (to the detriment, he asserted, of his antitax reputation). The court held that periodic cost-of-living pay increases were not discretionary acts of Congress and were therefore not independent laws that varied compensation in violation of the amendment. It is true that cost-of-living increases, though \"automatic\" under congressional legislation, may, like any other governmental expenditure, only take effect upon enactment of an appropriation statute, but the court did not find that procedure to be dispositive.\n\nOn appeal, the Tenth Circuit declined to reach the merits, finding instead that Congressman Schaffer also lacked standing, noting that \"the standing inquiry must be \u2018especially rigorous'\" when the dispute involves two branches of government. The circuit court held that the Congressman \"was not injured for standing purposes simply because he received a higher salary.\" If followed by later courts\u2014the Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari in the case\u2014the Tenth Circuit's reasoning would appear to foreclose standing to any plaintiff challenging a statute under the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Ironically, after lying dormant for two hundred years, this amendment may now have been put back to sleep. Nevertheless, it is clear that Congress still has the option of voluntarily abiding by the amendment.\n\nJohn C.

Amendment XXII\n\nAlthough the Twenty-second Amendment was clearly a reaction to Franklin D. Roosevelt's service as President for an unprecedented four terms, the notion of presidential term limits has long-standing roots in American politics. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 considered the issue extensively, although it ultimately declined to restrict the amount of time a person could serve as President. But following George Washington's decision to retire after his second elected term, numerous public figures subsequently argued he had established a \"two-term tradition\" that served as a vital check against any one person, or the presidency as a whole, accumulating too much power. Congress expressed its interest in presidential term limits by introducing 270 measures restricting the terms of office of the President prior to proposing the Twenty-second Amendment.\n\nNonetheless, sustained political attention to this matter only developed with Roosevelt. In 1946, lawmakers made the President's four terms an issue in congressional election campaigns, pledging to support a constitutional amendment that would prevent a similarly lengthy presidency in the future. In January of 1947, prominent House leaders acted on these campaign promises, introducing an initiative that ultimately became the Twenty-second Amendment.\n\nThe turning point in the debates on the measure occurred when Senator Warren Magnuson argued for an amendment that would simply bar someone from being \"elected to the office of President more than twice.\" Magnuson claimed that other proposals being considered were too \"complicated\" and comprehensive and might unfairly restrict a person who assumed the office of President \"through circumstances beyond his control, and with no deliberation on his part...but because of an emergency,\" such as the death of an elected President. When some legislators countered that Magnuson's proposal provided insufficient controls on those who assumed the presidency through these \"unfortunate circumstance[s],\" a compromise was struck. The final proposal provided a general prohibition against a person being elected to the office of the President more than twice while imposing additional restrictions on some individuals who attained the office of President through nonelectoral means, such as succession. The resulting language is what we now know as the Twenty-second Amendment.\n\nWe can safely conclude that those who drafted the amendment sought somehow to prevent the emergence of a President with a tenure as lengthy as Roosevelt's. Many proponents of the measure further argued that they sought to codify the two-term tradition associated with Washington. But although these observations surely point us to the general aspirations of the amendment's authors, they do not establish a specific picture of how the framers intended their proposal to apply.\n\nTo begin with, congressional deliberations about the amendment were curtailed. For example, the House restricted debate to two hours. Furthermore, the discussions leading up to the proposing of the Twenty-second Amendment did not obviously suggest a consistent, clear legislative purpose. Lawmakers expressed, at various times, their interest in limiting a President's \"service,\" \"terms,\" \"tenure,\" and \"[eligibility for] reelection,\" without elaborating exactly how they understood these terms. Moreover, when Congress dropped early proposals to foreclose a person's eligibility for office if he had served in two prior terms and instead adopted the current text that focuses on limiting individuals twice elected to the presidency, it provided little explanation for this important shift beyond needing \"compromise\" as part of the lawmaking process. One should also note that the framers of the amendment did not obviously intend to create a two-term tradition in any narrow sense, because they specifically discussed allowing someone who became President through an \"emergency\" within the first two years of one term to secure election for two additional terms. We are therefore left with some uncertainty about the precise goals of the Twenty-second Amendment's creators.\n\nThe ratification debates over the amendment do not provide much additional insight into the particular wishes of those who supported the proposal in the states. In general, the amendment does not appear to have prompted a great deal of public or legislative discussion once proposed by Congress.\n\nAlthough numerous court opinions make passing reference to the Twenty-second Amendment, its parameters have not been systematically examined by the judiciary. No doubt the low profile of the amendment in the courts reflects limited interest in and opportunity for testing the provision. Since the amendment was ratified, only five Presidents have been technically limited by it (Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan, William Jefferson Clinton, and George W. Bush were all twice elected), and, to date, none of these individuals seriously considered challenging the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning.\n\nThese facts should not lead one to conclude that the Twenty-second Amendment is so straightforward that it requires no further interpretation. Among other unresolved questions, the amendment seems to leave open the possibility that a twice-elected President could still become President through nonelectoral means. For example, such a person might still be elevated to the presidency after serving as Vice President, or, if authorized, to act as President through a presidential-succession statute.\n\nBruce Peabody Professor of Political Science Dept. of Soc. Sci. & History Fairleigh Dickinson University", "Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude \u2014 Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Amendment XV\n\nPassed by Congress on March 3, 1869, and ratified in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was the last of the three Reconstruction Amendments. Though the language of the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits all race-based discrimination in qualifications for voting, the Framers were primarily concerned with the enfranchisement of African-Americans. As early as 1866, many of the Republicans were convinced of the need for a constitutional amendment that would require the states to allow African-Americans to vote. Indeed, at one point the Joint Committee on Reconstruction voted to report a version of the Fourteenth Amendment that explicitly embraced the principle of race-blind suffrage. However, many Northerners continued to oppose black suffrage in principle, and fears of a political backlash led the committee to abandon the issue before the proposed amendment came to the floor. By 1869, the situation had changed. Although the outcome of referenda on black suffrage in the North continued to reflect the opposition of critical swing voters, other factors persuaded mainstream Republicans in Congress of the need for a federal constitutional amendment to deal with the issue.\n\nRepublicans had a variety of different reasons for supporting such an amendment. In the Reconstruction Act of 1867, Congress had forced black suffrage on the ex-Confederate states by statute, and Republicans faced the charge that they were hypocritical in not imposing the same requirement on Northern states. Some also believed that if blacks were enfranchised in the states that had remained in the Union, they would provide critical support for Republican candidates in those states. Still others argued that, even in the South, black suffrage would be insecure without a constitutional amendment and that the governments of the ex-Confederate states could not be returned to local control until the political power of the freed slaves was guaranteed.\n\nBy 1869, these considerations, combined with the conviction that allowing blacks to vote was right in itself, convinced virtually all mainstream congressional Republicans that a constitutional amendment was desirable. Republicans were, nevertheless, deeply divided over the question of what precise language should be adopted. Initially, the House of Representatives adopted a proposal quite similar to the current Fifteenth Amendment. However, a number of prominent Republicans complained that this narrow language would allow states intentionally to disfranchise most African-Americans by adopting qualifications that, although neutral on their face, would in practice be impossible for most freed slaves to satisfy. Responding to these and other concerns, the Senate proposed to eliminate not only discrimination on the basis of race, color, and previous condition of servitude but also discrimination on the basis of nativity, property, education, or creed in both the right to vote and the right to hold elective office. In ordinary circumstances, one might have expected a conference committee to have been convened at this point. However, in the complex parliamentary maneuvering that followed, the Senate did not vote to enter into conference; instead, the entire drafting process began again in both houses. The House then produced a draft that tracked the original Senate version, except that it deleted the reference to discrimination on the basis of education. The Senate, by contrast, now passed a simple prohibition on racial discrimination with respect to the rights to vote and hold office. A conference committee was convened, and it produced the current language of the Fifteenth Amendment, which embraced only the prohibition on racial discrimination in voting, omitting any reference to the right to hold office.\n\nIn short, because of the difficulty of agreeing to the precise language, the framers adopted a simple prohibition on discrimination on the basis of race, color, and previous condition of servitude even though there was a risk that a court could interpret the language narrowly and thereby allow deliberate evasion by facially neutral statutes. At first, the Supreme Court did exactly that and refused to inquire into the motives of those who adopted facially neutral statutes, such as literacy tests. Williams v. Mississippi (1898). Subsequently, the Court took a slightly broader view and voided a grandfather clause, the effect of which was to allow illiterate whites to vote, on the ground that it could have no conceivable purpose other than racial discrimination. Guinn v. United States (1915). More recently, the Court has invoked both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to invalidate facially neutral restrictions on voting rights where the legislative history reveals an intention to exclude or hinder African-Americans. Rogers v. Lodge (1982), Hunter v. Underwood (1985). The Court also invoked the amendments in cases where there was evident racial gerrymandering designed to disenfranchise blacks. Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960). On the other hand, the Court has held that race may be considered in the redistricting process only so long as racial considerations do not predominate, and there is no effort to dilute the voting strength of minorities. Bush v. Vera (1996).\n\nSimilarly, the Court adopted variable views on the sweep of allowable congressional authority under the enforcement clause. One critical issue was whether the amendment armed Congress with the power to regulate purely private action. Many of the congressional Republicans, who were responsible for passing the Fifteenth Amendment, apparently believed they had such authority: a section in a statute passed in 1870 made private, racially motivated interference with voting a federal crime. Nonetheless, although Ex parte Yarbrough (1884) suggested that this statute was constitutional, in 1903 the Supreme Court reversed course and held that the Fifteenth Amendment did not allow Congress to regulate purely private activity. James v. Bowman (1903). This basic principle was maintained until at least 1941, United States v. Classic, although the Court preferred to take the route of expansively defining nongovernmental activity as state action for purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment, applied particularly to the institution of the white primary. Smith v. Allwright (1944), Terry v. Adams (1953).\n\nAlthough the legislative history of the Fifteenth Amendment provides little direct guidance on the precise scope of the enforcement authority under Section 2, recent decisions have upheld the constitutionality of sweeping remedial measures adopted to combat government-imposed racial discrimination. For example, when Congress had evidence of widespread racial discrimination in state elections, the Court allowed Congress to place the entire state and local electoral apparatus under federal supervision and to forbid the adoption of measures that had even the effect of diluting the voting power of racial minorities. Thornburg v. Gingles (1986). The Court, asserting that enforcement power had the same breadth as a necessary and proper clause, has also upheld the power of Congress to forbid literacy tests.

Katzenbach (1966).\n\nEarl Maltz Distinguished Professor of Law Rutgers University School of Law, Camden", "Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShare Income Tax\n\nThe Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. Amendment XVI\n\nThe Sixteenth Amendment, approved by Congress in 1909 and ratified in 1913, made it possible for Congress to enact an income tax without having to worry about whether, under the rules applicable to direct taxes, the tax had to be apportioned among the states on the basis of population.\n\nCongress has the \"power to lay and collect taxes,\" including an income tax, but, under two constitutional provisions (see Article I, Section 2, Clause 3; Article I, Section 9, Clause 4), direct taxes must be apportioned\u2014a difficult requirement to satisfy. If an income tax is subject to apportionment, a state with one-tenth the national population, for example, has to bear one-tenth the aggregate tax liability, regardless of the state's financial condition. Suppose the populations of Iowa and Maine were equal, but Iowa's per capita income were twice Maine's. The rates for an apportioned income tax would have to be twice as high in Maine, the poorer state, as in Iowa. Such geographic variability makes it difficult, if not impossible, for anyone in Congress to support that kind of tax.\n\nNational real-estate taxes were enacted in antebellum America, with complex rules for apportionment\u2014the Founders intended direct taxes to be difficult, not impossible\u2014but, at the Founding, no one was thinking about an income tax. When this idea emerged and became politically possible, an income tax was assumed to be indirect, largely because Justices in Hylton v. United States (1796) had intimated, in dicta, that the term \"direct taxes\" was limited to capitation and real-estate taxes. Congress accordingly enacted an unapportioned income tax during the Civil War, and the Court, citing Hylton, upheld the tax in 1881. Springer v. United States (1881).\n\nIn 1894, with little attention to constitutional issues, Congress again enacted an unapportioned income tax with the clear goal of shifting the tax burden from regressive tariffs and excises to a levy based on ability of the individual to pay. Congressional debates were full of statements about how the well-to-do had not been paying their fair share. The authors of the income tax intended to accomplish what consumption taxes had not, and, to that end, the 1894 tax reached only the wealthiest one percent of the population.\n\nThis time the Supreme Court refused to approve the idea. In Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (1895), a closely divided Court reinvigorated the direct-tax clauses, holding that the 1894 tax was direct and, because not apportioned, unconstitutional. With Pollock on the books, something had to be done if there was to be an unapportioned income tax.\n\nNot every income-tax proponent thought a constitutional amendment was necessary after Pollock. Many believed the decision was so clearly wrong that the Court would decide differently if given another chance. In addition, supporters feared that if a campaign to amend the Constitution failed, the income tax would be doomed for years. In fact, some Congressmen \"backed\" the amendment precisely because they expected it to die in state legislatures.\n\nWhether Pollock was wrongly decided was, however, almost beside the point. Enacting a new tax to challenge a recent Supreme Court decision was politically risky. Even if wrong, the Court might not change its mind, particularly if Congress seemed to be questioning judicial authority. By 1909, it had become apparent there would be no income tax until the apportionment issue had been resolved.\n\nThe Sixteenth Amendment did that for \"taxes on incomes.\" By its terms, it exempted only such taxes from apportionment, leaving apportionment to apply to other direct taxes (including capitation and real-estate taxes, and, given Pollock's expanded conception of direct taxation, maybe more, like a direct-consumption tax). The sponsor, Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska, said he intended to limit the amendment's application in this way, to make an unapportioned income tax possible, and he rejected changes that would have eliminated the direct-tax clauses.\n\nDespite heated opposition, the amendment passed Congress with huge majorities. During ratification, Governor Charles Evans Hughes of New York raised a concern that the phrase \"from whatever source derived\" could be interpreted to permit national taxation of state and local bond interest, something the Pollock Court had said was inconsistent with intergovernmental immunity. Assured the amendment was not intended to overturn that doctrine, New York signed on and ratification proceeded swiftly.\n\nFacilitating an unapportioned income tax was hardly trivial, but some say the amendment did even more. Bruce Ackerman, for example, argues it was intended to repudiate all of Pollock, to contract the notion of \"direct taxes,\" and to revive the plenary taxing power. That interpretation gives more weight to the amendment than the \"taxes on incomes\" language comfortably bears, however, and it relies on the questionable assumption, derived from Hylton dicta, that modern forms of taxation are immune from limitation simply because the Court did not mention them in 1796.\n\nExcept in tax protester cases, where ineffectual arguments about the amendment's legitimacy are made, the amendment is not involved in litigation today. The Supreme Court has had no recent occasion to articulate the meaning of the amendment or to consider whether the amendment, which broadened congressional power, also contains restrictions on that power.\n\nThe general understanding among contemporary scholars is that the taxing power is so broad that Congress alone determines what can be reached by an income tax. This view of unbounded congressional power conflicts with the original, limited role of the amendment, however, and it requires rejecting several old Supreme Court decisions that took the language of the amendment seriously: for an unapportioned tax to be authorized by the Sixteenth Amendment, it must be on \"incomes.\"\n\nIn Eisner v. Macomber (1920), for example, the Court struck down an income tax as it applied to a stock dividend (a distribution not of money, but of additional shares), the receipt of which, said the Court, was not income. Even if the Court misunderstood stock dividends, as some have argued, the case remains significant for what it says about how the amendment should be interpreted. Throughout the 1920s, the Court assumed the term \"incomes\" had content, stressing that Congress could not circumvent apportionment by simply labeling a levy an income tax. These cases have not been overruled, and the Court has cited Macomber favorably, on nonconstitutional matters, as recently as 1991.\n\nIn one respect, the Court has revised the understanding of 1913. Interest on state and local bonds is no longer constitutionally exempt from income taxation; the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity advanced by Governor Hughes has been discarded in this context (although not as a result of the Sixteenth Amendment). See South Carolina v. Baker (1988).\n\nErik M. Jensen David L.

This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution. Amendment XVII\n\nThe Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, provided for the direct election of United States Senators, replacing the original method that had left the choice to state legislatures. Previously, state legislatures could choose Senators and fill vacancies at any time during a regular or special legislative session. After the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, it was recognized that the expense and inconvenience of election by popular vote made it necessary to schedule elections for Senators at regular intervals. To avoid the hardship to a state suffering a lack of representation pending a regular election, the Seventeenth Amendment also provided for methods of election or appointment to fill any unexpired term.\n\nThe language and history of the clause indicate that the states have the power to balance conflicting goals of a speedy popular election versus the state's interests in conducting elections on a regularized basis so as to maximize voter participation and minimize administrative expense. Thus, when the death of Robert F. Kennedy created a vacancy in New York's Senate delegation in June 1968, New York was permitted to postpone the election of his replacement until 1970, rather than being required to hold both a primary and general election by fall 1968. Valenti v. Rockefeller (1969). Following the death of Senator John Heinz in 1991, Pennsylvania was permitted to fill the vacancy by a special election, with the candidates to be chosen by party conventions of the state's two major parties. The Court held that the Seventeenth Amendment did not mandate that party nominees be chosen by popular vote, so long as the actual election was by popular vote. Trinsey v. Pennsylvania (1991).\n\nThe clause does not define when a vacancy exists. During the 2000 election, the people of Missouri knowingly voted for the deceased Mel Carnahan for Senator. The governor of the state declared this election to have created a vacancy, which he filled by appointing Carnahan's widow, Jean Carnahan, and then issued a writ of election for 2002. It remains an open question, however, whether the voters can create a Senate \"vacancy\" by knowingly voting for an ineligible candidate and allowing the governor to fill the position with an individual of his choice, as opposed to simply declaring the votes to be improper or \"spoiled\" ballots.\n\nTodd Zywicki Foundation Professor of Law George Mason University School of Law", "Change usually comes slowly, if at all, in Saudi Arabia. But its ruling elite have been wracked by a sudden, stunning shakeup in recent days.\n\nTwo weeks ago, King Salman announced the formation of an anti-corruption commission. By Monday, 11 Saudi princes, several business tycoons and at least 38 former or current government officials were reportedly under house arrest.\n\nThe driving force behind the surprise purge is King Salman\u2019s favorite son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. An ambitious young man in a hurry, Crown Prince Mohammed has spearheaded rapid changes in the political, economic and social spheres.\n\nThe 32-year-old\u2013often referred to by his initials, MBS\u2013has elbowed aside rival princes, reshuffled the royal pecking order, and moved ruthlessly to consolidate his own power. Now he heads the anticorruption commission, a new role that gives him tremendous leverage to further shake up the Saudi political and business elite, while reshaping Saudi Arabia\u2019s future.\n\nThe anti-corruption purge followed several previous moves to sideline rival princes and smooth MBS\u2019s path to become the first grandson of Ibn Saud, the founder of the Saudi Kingdom, to ascend the throne. Since Ibn Saud\u2019s death in 1953, the crown has passed from one to another of his sons, but that generation is long past its prime.\n\nThe increasingly assertive MBS has leapfrogged over older princes, raising the hackles of other clan factions who resent his drive to concentrate power in his own hands. His detractors see him as a brash and inexperienced newcomer, while his supporters see him as bold and decisive.\n\nNow he has raised the stakes by using the commission to discredit many prominent Saudis, including some of his cousins and other relatives.\n\nCorruption long has been a problem in Saudi Arabia. The boundaries between the coffers of state enterprises and the royal family\u2019s private pocketbooks have often been murky. Rooting out corruption would be a good thing, but it is not clear that it is the sole or even the primary motivation behind the crackdown.\n\nOne of the chief targets of the purge was Prince Mitab bin Abdullah, the Minister of the National Guard. He was one of the potential royal counterweights who could have constrained MBS\u2019s campaign to centralize power.\n\nAlthough Prince Mitab, the favorite son of the late King Abdullah who died in 2015, had already been outmaneuvered by MBS in the competition to become King, he remained a potential brake on the ambitions of the Crown Prince.\n\nPrince Mitab retained an independent base of support as leader of the powerful National Guard, a force of more than 100,000 troops drawn from loyal tribes that protected the royal family from internal and external enemies.\n\nThe National Guard also played a role as a praetorian guard that could block military coup attempts, a threat that had overthrown other Arab royal families in Egypt, Iraq and Libya. According to an old joke, every time the Saudis bought a tank for the army, they bought a tank destroyer for the National Guard, as insurance to maintain themselves in power.\n\nMBS, who already controlled the army as the Minster of Defense, previously had gained control over the Saudi Interior Ministry, another important security organ. His predecessor in that post, the well-respected Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, was sacked by the King in June.\n\nTo his credit, MBS also has gained a reputation as a reformer. He has promoted Vision 2030, an ambitious program to diversify the Saudi economy, reduce its dependence on oil export revenues, create a vibrant private sector, open up the economy to foreign investment and sell off part of the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco.\n\nMBS also has called for a return to a more moderate and tolerant form of Islam, which he contends existed in the kingdom before the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamic extremists. The violent clash with the extremists led the royal family to shore up ties with leaders of the Wahhabi religious establishment, a fundamentalist Islamic sect, as insurance against another outbreak of destabilizing zealotry.\n\nMBS has pushed back against the austere tenets of Wahhabi Islam by lifting restrictions on movies and concerts, supporting greater participation of women in the work force and removing restrictions that bar women from driving, starting next year.\n\nThese reform efforts have appealed to young Saudis, particularly the 70 percent of the population that is under the age of 30. They also are likely to support the anti-corruption campaign.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appears to be positioning himself to lead a revolution from above. If he succeeds, it will be a welcome alternative to the disastrous revolutions from below that destabilized many countries in the region during the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprisings.\n\nBut in pushing for rapid political, economic and social change, MBS risks provoking a backlash from Wahhabi religious leaders, as well as from disgruntled branches of the royal family who have been squeezed out of power or sidelined.\n\nIt remains to be seen how enduring his reforms and anti-corruption campaign will be. But the Crown Prince deserves credit for seeing that Saudi Arabia\u2019s status quo was unsustainable.\n\nNow he faces the challenge of proving that his bold leadership can advance the interests of the royal family and Saudi people, not just his own faction within the royal family.", "The intensifying Saudi-Iranian cold war is severely disrupting Lebanese politics.\n\nLebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned suddenly on Nov. 4, blaming Iranian interference in Lebanese affairs and the internal threat posed by Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanese Shiite surrogate.\n\nHariri\u2019s resignation speech was delivered from Saudi Arabia, which reportedly had pressured him to step down after summoning him to travel there on short notice. (Hariri returned to Lebanon late Tuesday for the country\u2019s Independence Day celebrations on Wednesday, and suspended his resignation.)\n\nThe Saudis, longtime backers of Hariri, Lebanon\u2019s leading Sunni political leader, sought to collapse Lebanon\u2019s fragile coalition government to delegitimize Hezbollah, the dominant faction within that government, and to push back against Iran and Hezbollah\u2019s threatening activities in the region.\n\nBut Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who is aligned with Hezbollah, refused to accept Hariri\u2019s resignation unless he presented it in person. Hariri then softened his position, saying that he might withdraw the resignation if Hezbollah respected Lebanon\u2019s policy of staying out of regional conflicts.\n\nThat is highly unlikely. Hezbollah was created, bankrolled, armed, and trained by Iran, which has deployed it in Syria to prop up Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Hezbollah also has been training and equipping Houthi rebels in Yemen, which Riyadh is fighting against, and which has resulted in a stalemate in the brutal Yemeni civil war.\n\nIranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen fired a ballistic missile at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Nov. 4. The Saudis launched a U.S.-made Patriot missile to destroy the incoming missile, which fell near King Khalid International Airport. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman charged that Iran had supplied the missile to the Houthis and that Iran\u2019s direct aggression \u201cmay be considered an act of war against the kingdom.\u201d\n\nAdding to the volatility, Israel also has been signaling that it will not tolerate a Hezbollah military buildup near its border with Syria. It warned Lebanon that it would suffer heavy consequences in another war, because Hezbollah is part of the government.\n\nHezbollah provoked a 2006 war with Israel, and Jerusalem warned that another war would be much more harmful to Lebanon\u2019s interests.\n\nBoth Saudi Arabia and Israel, which have been drawn together by the threat posed by Iran, are trying to drive a wedge between Hezbollah and other Lebanese factions by stressing that Hezbollah\u2019s aggressive efforts to promote Iran\u2019s agenda undermine Lebanese national interests.\n\nThe situation only worsened when Saudi Arabia ordered all Saudi citizens out of Lebanon on Nov. 6, after having accused Iran of declaring war on the Saudi nation.\n\nIn response, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned Saudi actions. \u201cIt is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,\u201d he said, adding that Saudi actions are purposefully inciting Israel to attack Lebanon.\n\nThe State Department declared U.S. support for Lebanon and condemned \u201cany actions that could threaten [its] stability.\u201d\n\nThe statement indirectly acknowledged the illegitimacy of Hezbollah by declaring: \u201cThe United States firmly reiterates that the Lebanese armed forces and other Lebanese state security forces are the only legitimate security authorities in Lebanon.\u201d\n\nIf the crisis is not resolved, Saudi Arabia is likely to escalate economic pressure on Hezbollah, rather than take military action. Riyadh could resort to expelling Lebanese workers from the kingdom, cutting off diplomatic relations, or even sanctioning Lebanese remittances from the Gulf, which would cripple the Lebanese economy.\n\nIt is in the national interest of the U.S. to support peace and stability in Lebanon, but also to prevent Hezbollah from threatening U.S. allies both inside and outside of Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty will be at risk until Hezbollah has been disarmed and demobilized.\n\nThat will be fiercely resisted by Hezbollah and will not happen anytime soon. But a path has been laid out by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which endorsed the cease-fire that ended Hezbollah\u2019s war against Israel in 2006.\n\nThe resolution called for the full implementation of the 1989 Ta\u2019if Accords, which ended the Lebanese civil war and required the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon, so that \u201cthere will be no weapons or authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese state.\u201d\n\nIn order to further pressure Hezbollah to abide by international agreements and demobilize, Washington should sanction more top Hezbollah figures, as well as Iran for supporting Hezbollah and undermining Lebanese sovereignty. Washington should back its allies and warn Iran that it will pay an increasingly steep price for its hostile policies.\n\nIn addition to its subversion of Lebanese sovereignty, Tehran sought to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington in 2011 and sacked the Saudi Embassy in Tehran in 2016.\n\nNow, Iran is turning Yemen into a base for terrorism against Saudi Arabia, in much the same way that it turned Lebanon into a base for terrorism against Israel.\n\nHezbollah also was implicated in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the father of Saad Hariri, the current prime minister, which is one reason that the younger Hariri has said he fears for his safety inside Lebanon.\n\nHariri has now returned to Lebanon, but thanks to Iran and its efforts to intimidate Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, his independence, and that of Lebanon itself, have been increasingly diminished.", "President Donald Trump on Wednesday kept his campaign promise to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and ordered the State Department to make plans to eventually move the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.\n\nThe long-delayed, symbolic move addressed a historic injustice: Israel is the only country in the world not allowed to choose its own capital. Trump also exercised America\u2019s sovereign right to recognize the capital of a close ally and choose the location of its own embassy.\n\nIn recent years, the refusal of many nations to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital has become an integral part of the international campaign to de-legitimize Israel.\n\nBy recognizing Israeli sovereignty and historic ties to its capital city, the president not only struck a dramatic blow against this campaign, but reaffirmed the importance of close Israeli-American ties.\n\nThe president\u2019s announcement also corrects a longtime historic anomaly: that the U.S. has a consulate general in Jerusalem to conduct diplomatic relations with the Palestinians, but no embassy in Jerusalem for engaging Israelis.\n\nThe commitment to move the embassy was already a longstanding U.S. policy. Congress voted by a bipartisan majority to pass the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which called for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999, but allowed presidents to waive the move on national security grounds.\n\nEvery president since then has signed the waiver due to fear of provoking a backlash that would threaten U.S. interests and reduce the prospects for a final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nBut the Oslo peace process stalled anyway, primarily due to continued Palestinian terrorism that undermined Israeli willingness to make increasingly risky concessions in exchange for Palestinian promises that often were not kept.\n\nNo Good Deed Goes Unpunished in the Middle East\n\nThe president is making a calculated gamble that Palestinian and other Arab leaders are more interested in negotiating a peace agreement, restraining extremism, and cooperating to contain Iran, than in escalating a confrontation with Israel and the United States.\n\nU.S. officials have clearly stated that the president\u2019s Jerusalem statement does not foreclose on peace negotiations, negate Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem, or rule out the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nMoreover, they have stressed that the Jerusalem statement does not alter U.S. policy toward the Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem, which will remain under Jordanian administrative control. This is important because control of the sites has been a highly emotional issue that anti-Israeli extremists have exploited to incite violence against Israel.\n\nBut Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and other Islamist extremist movements are likely to seize on the Jerusalem issue to whip up opposition to the United States and Israel. There is a risk that this could distract Washington\u2019s Arab allies and reduce their willingness to publicly cooperate with the United States to combat these forces.\n\nThere is also a risk that the Jerusalem statement could enable troublemakers to mobilize anti-American demonstrations and possibly riots. Terrorists also might use it as a pretext for attacks on the U.S. or Israel that they were already inclined to launch in any case.\n\nAcknowledging Reality Gives Peace a Chance\n\nThe president has recognized a reality\u2014that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital\u2014without taking a position on the city\u2019s final status that would be incompatible with a negotiated settlement.\n\nNevertheless, the president\u2019s statement could disrupt Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the short run. But those negotiations have been moribund for years.\n\nAnti-Israeli and anti-Western Muslim states and movements opposed to any peace with Israel will willfully distort the implications of the move and exploit it for propaganda purposes.\n\nIf the Palestinian Authority chooses to intentionally misinterpret the implications of the president\u2019s Jerusalem statement, then it is an indication that it is more concerned with denying Israel\u2019s rights and sovereignty than with reaching a peace agreement that could affirm its own rights and sovereignty.\n\nThis would mean it is not a genuine partner for peace, but remains locked into the old zero-sum thinking that has perpetuated the conflict at great cost to the Palestinian and Israeli people.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement could have a positive impact in the long run if it shocks Palestinian and other Arab leaders into recognizing that the longer they wait to genuinely accept Israel\u2019s existence and sign a peace treaty, the less they can expect to gain from such a treaty.\n\nThe bottom line is that Trump has acted to implement a policy long mandated by law and supported by a bipartisan majority in Congress.\n\nWhile his Jerusalem statement may complicate peace negotiations and undermine cooperation with Arab allies in the short run, it reflects a realism that could benefit U.S. policy and Arab thinking in the long run.", "Iran has been rocked by a wave of protests against the Islamist regime since Dec. 28.

Their demands varied.\n\nSome chanted, \u201cWe don\u2019t want an Islamic Republic\u201d and \u201cDeath to the dictator,\u201d the latter being a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nEconomic Resentments Amplify Political Revulsion\n\nThe protests apparently were triggered by a surge in prices of basic food supplies, which also had contributed to early Arab Spring protests six years ago. Protests spread quickly, sparked by social media posts, as state-controlled media blocked press coverage.\n\nThese are the largest protests since millions of Iranians flooded the streets in 2009 to protest against then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s rigged re-election. But the regime crushed those protests in a brutal crackdown in which at least 30 people were killed and thousands were arrested, tortured, and imprisoned.\n\nSo far, the ongoing protests have not reached the size of the 2009 Green Movement demonstrations, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in protest. Twelve people have been killed in demonstrations, with 10 of the deaths inflicted amid intensifying clashes on Sunday night.\n\nSome of the early protests in Mashhad reportedly were organized by ultra-hard-line regime supporters opposed to Rouhani, and may have been designed to undermine his authority.\n\nPro-regime demonstrations denouncing the 2009 Green Movement leaders also may have provoked a political backlash.\n\nUnemployment remains high at more than 12 percent, and inflation has resurged to 10 percent. A recent increase in egg and poultry prices by as much as 40 percent, which a government spokesman blamed on a cull over avian-flu fears, appears to have been the spark for the economic protests.\n\nHundreds of students and others joined a new economic protest at Tehran University, a hotbed of prior student protests against the regime. Iranian students historically have played a leading role in several revolutionary movements, including the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe tense situation at Tehran University will be a litmus test for the strength of the protest movement and of the regime\u2019s ability to contain, suffocate, or crush the protests.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guards, which crushed protests in 2009 and take the lead in exporting Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution and terrorism, remain a strong repressive force that is likely to crush the student rebellion if the local police prove to be inadequate.\n\nTrump\u2019s Rapid Response\n\nTrump tweeted out his support for the protests Saturday morning:\n\nMany reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime\u2019s corruption & its squandering of the nation\u2019s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people\u2019s rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2017\n\nTrump is right that simmering resentment over the costs of Iran\u2019s aggressive foreign policy have led protesters to call for more spending at home and less on support of radical groups abroad.\n\nSome of the new protests have specifically denounced the regime\u2019s extensive corruption and its costly involvement in regional conflicts, such as those in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn Mashhad, some chanted, \u201cNot Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran,\u201d a reference to what protesters say is the regime\u2019s focus on exporting the revolution, rather than responding to domestic needs.\n\nThey also denounced Iran\u2019s theocratic leaders: \u201cThe people are begging; the clerics act like God.\u201d\n\nWashington must continue to drive up the long-term political, economic, and military costs of Iran\u2019s military interventions in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. It should underscore that the regime\u2019s economic mismanagement, corruption, and support for terrorism and Islamic revolution, which provoked sanctions, have exacerbated Iran\u2019s economic problems.\n\nU.S. policy should also highlight and denounce the regime\u2019s repression and human rights abuses. But the protests might soon be quelled, dissolve into competing camps led by rival leaders, or be hijacked by hostile anti-Western forces, as many of the Arab Spring revolts were hijacked.\n\nWashington should support the right of Iranians to challenge the heavy-handed repression and corruption of a tyrannical regime, but it should hold off on endorsing specific opposition leaders or movements until their character and goals are assessed.\n\nUntil then, the Trump administration should do its best to publicize and promote the legitimate political and economic grievances of frustrated Iranians and support their efforts to recover freedom from an Islamist dictatorship that depends on thugs to suppress its own people.", "President Donald Trump set the stage for ending or mending the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear agreement when he announced on October 13 that he would not certify the agreement. Under the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), which requires a certification statement every 90 days, the President found that the sanctions relief granted by the nuclear deal was not \u201cappropriate and proportionate\u201d to the specific and verifiable measures taken by Iran with respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program. President Trump also asked Congress to amend current law to strengthen the enforcement of the agreement, take actions to prevent Iran from developing long-range ballistic missiles, and make permanent the restrictions that are set to expire under the nuclear deal.\n\nUnder INARA, Congress had 60 days to vote on an expedited basis whether to re-impose sanctions on Iran that were suspended under the nuclear deal. But Congress, busy with other issues, punted the issue back to the President. The President faces deadlines this week about certification once again, as well as whether to renew waivers suspending various nuclear sanctions. President Trump should keep his options open, renew the waivers, and work with Congress to address the problems inherent in the botched nuclear deal.\n\nU.S. foreign policy is strongest when the President acts with clear congressional backing. But if Congress is unable to reach a consensus in the coming weeks on supporting the President\u2019s efforts to remedy problems with the nuclear agreement, then President Trump should unilaterally terminate the agreement.\n\nA Misconceived Nuclear Deal\n\nThe nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is a risky and fundamentally flawed agreement that gave Tehran massive sanctions relief up-front\u2014while only requiring it to make temporary and easily reversible concessions on its nuclear program. It did not block Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions but only postponed them. Key restrictions on Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities expire after 10 years. Under the JCPOA, Iran is given a green light to operate its covertly built, formerly illicit nuclear facilities and gradually expand its uranium enrichment program to an industrial scale. This legitimized Iran\u2019s past nuclear cheating and paved the way for a patient path to nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is difficult to argue that the JCPOA effectively advances U.S. goals when Tehran publicly refuses to allow inspections of its military bases in violation of the terms of the deal, develops ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads, and eagerly anticipates the expiration of key restrictions on its uranium-enrichment activities.\n\nThe JCPOA made a bad situation worse by boosting Iran\u2019s dictatorship in the economic, military, and geopolitical spheres. Contrary to the promises of the Obama Administration, the nuclear deal has not moderated Iran\u2019s foreign policy. In fact, since the nuclear deal was sealed in 2015, Tehran has cashed in on the sanctions relief provided under the JCPOA, invested heavily in terrorist proxies, and stepped up its hostile activities in the region.\n\nIran has harassed U.S. Navy ships in international waters, held American sailors hostage at gunpoint, aggressively intervened to shore up Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s Syrian dictatorship, remained the world\u2019s foremost sponsor of terrorism, and illegally smuggled increasingly sophisticated arms to Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nGiven clear Iranian violations of the bans on exporting arms and the travel of designated Iranian officials that were restated under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the nuclear agreement, it would be foolhardy to presume that Iran would not violate its nuclear restrictions if and when it suits its interests.\n\nAs President Trump said in his September 19, 2017, speech to the U.N. General Assembly: \u201cWe cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles[,] and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.\u201d[REF]\n\nTime to Nix or Fix the JCPOA\n\nThe Obama Administration, knowing that the nuclear agreement would be rejected by the Senate if it was submitted as a treaty, crafted the deal as a nonbinding political agreement. The JCPOA, which was implemented through executive orders, can therefore be dismantled by executive orders. President Trump could terminate the JCPOA through an executive order restoring sanctions on Iran. Or he could simply decide not to renew the waivers on nuclear-related sanctions suspended under the JCPOA when they expire (between January 10 and 17, 2018) for the Iran Sanctions Act, Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act, and Section 1245 of the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe Trump Administration should:\n\nExercise prudence in the timing of policy announcements . The White House must be careful about the timing of its decisions on the JCPOA. It would be prudent to focus first on the simmering crisis with North Korea, which already has nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Not only is it the wolf closest to the sled, but buying time on the Iran nuclear issue could minimize the risks of fighting a two-front war. The Administration also should avoid diverting attention from the current anti-regime protests in Iran, which are eroding the regime\u2019s increasingly narrow base of support. Triggering a crisis with Iran now would allow Tehran to mobilize popular support, exploit a nationalist issue, and allow the regime to blame Iran\u2019s economic problems on foreign sanctions. The Administration always can walk away from the nuclear deal at a later date, so the sanctions waiver deadlines need not be a determining factor in forging U.S. policy. Even if the Administration renews waivers on sanctions in January, its decertification statement and announced intention to bolster or leave the JCPOA will put the nuclear deal in limbo and diminish Tehran\u2019s economic benefits by discouraging foreign investment in Iran. And after its next decertification statement, Congress again will have a 60-day window to approve legislation on a fast-track basis.\n\nWork with Congress to tighten nuclear restrictions on Iran. The Trump Administration should work with Congress to enact legislation to address the weaknesses of the agreement. The White House reportedly has met with Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss legislation that would impose additional constraints on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. By mandating the restoration of nuclear sanctions if Tehran crossed designated red lines on enriched-uranium stockpiles, centrifuge development, or other benchmarks, Washington could unilaterally extend key restrictions on Iran\u2019s accumulation of fissile material beyond the sunset provisions that expire within 15 years under the JCPOA. This would deprive Tehran of the option of ramping up to industrial-scale uranium enrichment to shorten the time required to stage a nuclear breakout. Tehran would need much more time to make the final sprint to a nuclear weapons capability, giving Washington more opportunity to fashion diplomatic, sanctions, and possible military responses.\n\nPressure Iran to accept stronger restrictions on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Although Tehran has ruled out renegotiating the JCPOA, it may see reason to negotiate a more acceptable follow-on agreement, once it becomes clear that the JCPOA is doomed and it needs to compromise to avoid the return of crippling sanctions. If Iran ignores the red lines set out by the Trump Administration, it will bear the onus for triggering the termination the JCPOA. A firm U.S. policy backed by a united front of the White House and Congress also could give European allies an incentive to pressure Tehran to accept a renegotiated nuclear deal. President Emmanuel Macron has indicated France could support negotiations for a new accord that addresses U.S. concerns. Other allies could fall into line once they realize that their plans to expand trade with Iran will be blocked by U.S. sanctions unless the weaknesses of the JCPOA are corrected.\n\nIf Congress Balks, the President Must Act Unilaterally\n\nThe Obama Administration settled for deferring, not preventing, an Iranian nuclear capability. President Trump has rejected this course and adopted a hardline policy that will include renewed sanctions if the JCPOA is not adequately reinforced or renegotiated. To strengthen the deterrent effect of the \u201csanctions sword of Damocles\u201d suspended over Tehran, it would be preferable if the Administration worked closely with Congress to address the flaws of the JCPOA. Bipartisan congressional support is an important pillar for sustaining long-term U.S. foreign policy. But if Congress is not willing or able to present a united front against Tehran on the nuclear issue, then President Trump must go it alone to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea.\n\n\u2014James Phillips is Senior Research Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.", "Donald Trump\u2019s election as president has discomforted many foreign leaders, especially in Iran.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed Wednesday that there is \u201cno possibility\u201d for the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran to be overturned by Trump, despite Trump\u2019s threat to do so.\n\nThis is an outright lie. President Barack Obama purposely structured the deal as an executive agreement to make an end-run around Congress, which he knew would oppose the flawed and risky deal.\n\nAfter his inauguration, Trump would have the authority to revoke the executive agreement. Trump has called the deal \u201cdisastrous\u201d and said his \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d would be to dismantle it.\n\nIran\u2019s state television channel reported that Rouhani told his Cabinet that Tehran\u2019s \u201cunderstanding in the nuclear deal was that the accord was not concluded with one country or government but was approved by a resolution of the U.N. Security Council and there is no possibility that it can be changed by a single government.\u201d\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif chimed in to urge Trump to accept the agreement: \u201cEvery U.S. president has to understand the realities of today\u2019s world. The most important thing is that the future U.S. president stick to agreements, to engagements undertaken.\u201d\n\nThat is laughable advice, coming from the hypocritical leaders of a country that regularly violates international law by sponsoring terrorism, taking hostages, harassing shipping in international waters\u2014not to mention violating U.N. Security Council resolutions by exporting arms to Palestinian terrorist groups, Hezbollah terrorists, Syrian militias, and Yemeni rebels.\n\nIran has also been caught trying to covertly buy illicit dual-use nuclear technology in Germany. This violates its commitments under the nuclear agreement to obtain international approval for all nuclear purchases.\n\nThe new administration could use these or other violations as a justification for doing away with the nuclear deal.\n\nTrump has promised to enforce the nuclear deal so strictly that it will be patently clear that Iran is responsible for the deal\u2019s demise. During the presidential campaign he said:\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve taken over some bad contracts. I buy contracts where people screwed up and they have bad contracts. But I\u2019m really good at looking at a contract and finding things within a contract that, even if they\u2019re bad, I would police that contract so tough that they don\u2019t have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract.\n\nIran\u2019s dictators have had an easy time out-negotiating and out-maneuvering the Obama administration, which eagerly sought to clinch a deal. The administration made huge concessions that allowed Iran to dismantle international sanctions without dismantling key elements of its nuclear program, which continues to advance.\n\nIt looks like the Trump administration will take a much harder line on the Iran nuclear issue, which will be one of the earliest foreign policy issues it must address.", "Spain\u2019s experiment with being a \u201cnation of nations\u201d is failing. By fostering separate official languages and regional identities, it has courted division. Today, it is being torn apart as separatists in Catalonia agitate for independence.\n\nThis is happening in a country that is prosperous and free. Americans have every reason to consider it a warning.\n\nThe lesson for us is all the more stark given that Spain inherited this problem (before arguably making it worse). The United States, on the other hand, has gone out of its way to create it. Building \u201ca cosmopolitan federation of national colonies,\u201d in the words of the influential early 20th century transnationalist Randolph Bourne, has been the object of many U.S. policies for decades.\n\nEspecially instructive should be one of the Catalonian separatists\u2019 arguments for leaving Spain: that their region is the wealthiest, and they\u2019d like to stop subsidizing the rest. As countless voices on the left and right have been warning for some time, dividing a country into ethnic groups through \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d militates against the transfer payments on which modern welfare societies depend.\n\nOr, as Trevor Phillips, a British Labour politician, put it in an important pamphlet last year: \u201ceven those of us on the progressive wing of politics must now surely accept that in the conditions of today\u2019s society, our reflex defence of \u2026 separate communities is actually undermining one of the most cherished of left-wing values\u2014social solidarity.\u201d\n\nMany studies back this view. One done at Harvard in 2003 found that ethnic and linguistic \u201cfractionalization\u201d in a society \u201cis highly negatively correlated with GDP per capita growth, schooling and telephones per capita\u201d and many other social goods.\n\nEthnic and linguistic fractionalization is what Spain promoted after it became a democracy upon the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. During a nearly 40-year strong-arm rule, Franco had suppressed the use of such languages as Catalan and Basque in the northeast and Galician in the Northwest.\n\nThese languages have stubbornly persisted since the early Middle Ages, despite the union of different kingdoms that took place in 1469 when Queen Isabella of Castile and Leon married King Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\nThat is Spain\u2019s history. Spanish leaders reacted to Franco\u2019s dictatorship with a pendulum swing in the opposite direction. The 1978 Constitution gave 17 autonomous regions power over education and language. Basque, Catalan and Galician were given co-official status with Castilian in their respective regions. Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez reaffirmed last month that Spain would remain a \u201cnation of nations.\u201d\n\nAmerican history has been the opposite. The founders knew the new country they were building would attract immigrants \u2014 as it had already done in their time. Their consensus was that Americans would be able to keep their republic only if newcomers adopted the values the framers were nurturing.\n\nGeorge Washington wrote of immigrants that he hoped that \u201cby an intermixture with our people, they, or their descendants, get assimilated to our customs, measures, and laws: in a word, soon become one people.\u201d For Alexander Hamilton, \u201cthe safety of a republic depends essentially on the energy of a common national sentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits \u2026 and on the love of country.\u201d Lincoln and some of American\u2019s best writers, such Emerson and Melville, also referred to these ideals.\n\nAt the turn of the last century, self-declared transnationalist intellectuals such as Bourne posited the opposite view. \u201c[T]here are two ideals of American nationalism,\u201d he wrote in 1916. \u201cOne is that of the traditional melting pot, the other is that of a co-operation of cultures.\u201d\n\nBourne and his allies were defeated in the court of public opinion by a bipartisan group of assimilationists that included Democrats such as Woodrow Wilson and Republicans such as Teddy Roosevelt. The latter stated the Founder\u2019s contract in this manner: \u201cWe should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else.\u201d\n\nBut the transnationalists found fertile soil in academia, and reappeared later.\n\nIn the \u201870s, the Office of Management and Budget began to divide the country into abstract ethnic groups. Hispanics and Asians were added as categories to the Census in 1980. Last year, the Obama Administration proposed adding MENA (for Middle East and North Africa).\n\nThe people in question initially resist being forced into these categories. But as videos of the 2015 Census brainstorming meetings that led to the MENA proposals make clear, leaders of special-interest groups argue that government benefits will entice acceptance in the end. School-based instruction championing \u201ccultural retention\u201d and discouraging inter-cultural mixing through \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d shaming will take care of the rest.\n\nIn 1997, T. Alexander Aleinikoff, a senior official in the Clinton administration\u2019s Immigration and Naturalization Service, wrote a clarifying article \u2014 in which he favorably quoted Bourne \u2014 explaining that the task of policy was to promote an America made up of \u201cconstituent groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increasing and resilient diversity \u2014 the polyethnicism \u2014 of the United States is a current and future fact,\u201d he wrote. What is needed, he added, was \u201cpolicies that foster a nation at peace with its constituent groups and groups that identify with the nation.\u201d\n\nCatalonia is showing us every day that this contradiction, like many others, does not work.", "Trump Administration trade officials and their Canadian and Mexican counterparts are reportedly debating the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nThose key investor protections help to secure American property rights protection and the rule of law. They also advance the White House\u2019s pursuit of a trade policy that serves the interests of American workers.\n\nISDS protects Americans by enshrining the principles of U.S. rule of law in each investor dispute, extending to those investors essential private property protections under U.S. law that include fairness and due process, compensation for foreign government seizure of property, and non-discrimination. Through ISDS, U.S. investors have assurance of their legal rights under the U.S. Constitution as well as the Administrative Procedure Act. Withdrawing ISDS would eliminate these basic property rights for U.S. investors.\n\nThe principal ISDS provisions of NAFTA are found in:\n\nChapter 11, which \u201cestablishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures both equal treatment among investors\u2026in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due process before an impartial tribunal\u201d; and\n\nChapter 19, \u201ca mechanism to provide an alternative to judicial review by domestic courts of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases.\u201d [REF]\n\nISDS mechanisms have been included in many trade agreements to secure basic legal protections for a signatory state\u2019s nationals abroad. Four basic protections are central to ISDS:\n\nMinimum standards of treatment. Host nations must provide investors with fair and equitable treatment and full legal protection and security, either as defined by the agreement or as limited to the international minimum standard. Due process. Nations must follow defined, legal processes. They may not invoke arbitrary and capricious measures in cases involving foreign investors. Non-discrimination. The protections for foreign investors must be the same as those for domestic investors. Moreover, the most favored nation standard [REF] mandates that host states may not discriminate between foreign investors from different nations. Expropriation. Nations cannot directly (for instance, by nationalization); indirectly (such as by breaking a contract or in other circuitous ways); or \u201ccreepingly\u201d (by gradual means) render an investment valueless without compensating the investor. [REF]\n\nISDS protections provide a neutral, independent arbitration process that enables investors or business interests to settle disputes without triggering state-to-state conflict. They ensure that, even in foreign or local jurisdictions where preferential treatment may otherwise be given to host entities, Americans are guaranteed fair treatment consistent with the U.S. Constitution and thus similar to the protections they enjoy in the U.S.\n\nThese ISDS protections are fundamental to the free flow of trade among NAFTA member nations. They are essential to the protection of secure American interests in any trade agreement due to their ability to safeguard fair, unbiased, and transparent legal processes.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom[REF] makes clear year after year that a free and open investment environment gives entrepreneurs the incentive to expand economic activity and generate productivity improvements that lead to creation of more American jobs.\n\nAs the Index also notes, protection of property rights is a central motivating force for workers and investors. A key aspect of property rights protection is the enforcement of contracts\u2014one of the foundations of a successful market system. ISDS provisions help to ensure the even-handed government enforcement of private contracts that is essential to ensuring equity and integrity in the marketplace. The ISDS mechanisms that are included in more than 3,000 international agreements require the U.S. and foreign countries to treat all investors equally under the law.\n\nISDS panels created by trade and investment agreements between nations, such as NAFTA, act to prevent discrimination against or among foreign investors, either through expropriation, direct discrimination, or other nefarious regulatory actions.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the weakened economy since the Great Recession has been depressed levels of investment. The substantial expansion in the size and scope of government, increased regulatory and tax burdens, and the loss of confidence that has accompanied a growing perception of cronyism, elitism, and corruption has severely undermined global competitiveness.\n\nKeeping ISDS in NAFTA will help to protect American companies and workers from unfair treatment by the Mexican or Canadian governments\u2014preventing the seizure of profits and assets without due process. In the past dozen or so years, the U.S. government has won every ISDS case filed against it by foreign investors, often because the U.S. legal system functions well and because U.S. politicians eschew the invasion of investors\u2019 treaty rights.\n\nISDS lawsuits filed in Canada and Mexico have resulted in settlements for American companies of over $100 million\u2014compensation that would not be available if ISDS were eliminated from NAFTA. If American companies had to rely on traditional state-to-state dispute-settlement mechanisms and weaker legal protections for private property in Canada and Mexico, the result would be reduced protections for American investors.\n\nISDS provisions can also open foreign markets for exports of U.S. products made by American workers. Tougher ISDS rules block potentially protectionist efforts by foreign governments, such as local-content mandates, local employment quotas, and export percentages.\n\nISDS enjoys bipartisan support in Congress. In 2015, a solid majority of sixty Senators rejected arguments by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013MA)[REF] and others against ISDS provisions in the Trade Promotion Authority renewal legislation.\n\nSenator Warren has continued the criticism on ISDS from the left, most recently when she urged U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to remove ISDS provisions from NAFTA.[REF]\n\nThe Trump Administration should continue to stand firm against such arguments, and seek to retain the ISDS protections that are so vital for securing a free and open multilateral investment environment in NAFTA partner countries.\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers and more than one hundred other American business groups have urged the Trump Administration to ensure fair treatment by foreign governments by maintaining and improving ISDS enforcement and the protection of U.S. property overseas.[REF]\n\nWithout ISDS, it would be easier for foreign allies to discriminate against the products and services that American workers manufacture and export to Canada and Mexico.\n\nAlthough Americans\u2019 trust in government has reached all-time lows, NAFTA has been one government-to-government agreement that has served them well. Maintaining transparent, independent, and neutral arbitration mechanisms in trade agreements for resolving foreign investment disputes\u2014and protecting Americans\u2019 property rights and their right to the rule of law\u2014is one way to restore that trust.\n\n\u2014James M. Roberts is Research Fellow in the Center for International Trade and Economics, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.", "For all the hand-wringing over the \u201cwage gap\u201d between men and women, there\u2019s far less there than meets the eye. Once you account for factors that affect every worker\u2019s pay level\u2014things such as education, experience, choice of industry and occupation, career interruptions and hours worked\u2014the so-called \u201cgap\u201d all but disappears.\n\n\n\nA major discrepancy exists only when these highly relevant factors are ignored. Hyping the raw statistic\u2014\u201cWomen are paid only 78 cents on the man\u2019s dollar!\u201d\u2014without the relevant context creates problems.\n\n\n\nFor starters, it misrepresents the actual situation. Worse, the bogus claim is invariably accompanied by demands for government to do something to \u201ccorrect\u201d the trumped-up problem. Worst of all, the remedies typically demanded are actually counter-productive, harming those they are intended to help the most.\n\n\n\nWhen addressing barriers to employment and higher earnings for women, we must be careful to pursue only those policies that actually help the least advantaged.\n\n\n\nTo that end, let\u2019s first clarify the size and nature of the actual wage gap. The 78 cents on the dollar figure reflects the median earnings of full-time male and female wage workers, as reported in the Census Bureau\u2019s 2013 Current Population Survey. Divide the median earnings for women working at least 30 hours a week by that of men working at least 30 hours a week, and you get 78 percent. That figure changes dramatically, however, if you take into account the very important factors listed above. It falls to a far less shocking \u2014 and far more equitable \u2014 95 percent.\n\n\n\nThe wage gap is far greater for minority women precisely because of these factors. According to Milia Fisher, with the left-leaning Center of American Progress,\u201cAfrican-American and Hispanic women are significantly less likely to graduate from high school or to get a bachelor\u2019s degree than white women.\u201d\n\n\n\nFisher goes on to argue that: \u201cPolicies such as paid family and medical leave and paid sick days would help ensure that women of color are better able to balance work and family.\u201d Others have recommended raising the minimum wage, since those jobs are more commonly held by women than men.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, all of these policy \u201cfixes\u201d have the unintended effect of dimming the job prospects of those they are meant to help.\n\n\n\nEmployers consider how much they pay people overall, not whether that compensation comes in the form of cash wages or equivalent benefits. That means that mandatory paid family and medical leave is typically paid for by workers themselves in the form of reduced wages. And because women are more likely than men to use these benefits, it can hurt their employment prospects.\n\n\n\nInstead, federal law should lift restrictions that prevent certain workers from taking overtime pay in the form of paid time off instead of cash. This would give workers more flexibility in structuring how they wish to receive compensation.\n\n\n\nAs for hiking the minimum wage: Artificially high wages create unemployment. Minimum-wage jobs are typically entry-level jobs, offering opportunity to those with few marketable skills. These are the people hit hardest by mandated wage hikes.\n\n\n\nIn a free economy, wage earnings reflect worker productivity. Employers and employees contract with each other to find the best arrangement for each party. Government regulation adds costs to these arrangements and limits the forms they may take. This interference, though well-intentioned, inevitably kills jobs and restrains wages for workers.\n\n\n\nLuckily, government can help boost wages by lifting harmful restrictions that prevent individuals from earning a living using their own skills and aptitudes. Costly licensing requirements, for example, block many individuals from making a good living, even without a college degree, as makeup artists, bartenders, florists, hair braiders, etc. Governments could also ease land-use restrictions and zoning laws that increase the cost of housing for the least advantaged, relegating them to neighborhoods far away from better job opportunities and higher wages.\n\n\n\nWe have a moral responsibility to pursue public policies that eliminate barriers to the employment of the least advantaged among us. Let\u2019s make sure we choose those that actually work.\n\n-Boccia is the Grover M.

President Donald Trump released a plan that called for significant changes on both levels. Congress anticipates taking up the issue once health care and budgeting have cleared the deck.\n\nAmericans see a great need to update the tax system. A majority support minor or even major reforms. However, reform on the individual side motivates Americans\u2019 political behavior far more than reform on the business side. Moreover, Americans have differing ideas of what reform should look like, and even the ultimate goal of tax policy as a whole, which hints at the potential for opposition from those who place high importance on reforms in the direction of higher rather than lower rates.\n\nPerhaps a greater challenge, however, is the prevalent misinformation and misperception about the current tax burden, especially that borne by American businesses. A sense of unfairness and concern that corporations get away with not paying their fair share is propped up by an underlying belief that the corporate tax rate is significantly lower than it truly is.\n\nEducating Americans on the true combined federal and state business rate of 39 percent can help in building support for lower rates, as can comparison to other similar countries\u2019 rates. Every country in the developed world has rates lower than those of the U.S. When Americans know these facts, a majority support reducing the rate to make it more competitive.\n\nShowing the impact of high rates on everyday Americans can also build support for a lower, more competitive corporate tax rate. Although divided on the specifics of tax policy, Americans are united in the concern that reduced corporate tax rates benefit workers and consumers through job creation and low prices. Emphasizing these themes and educating Americans on the actual rates that currently burden businesses can help unite opinion on and build support for a lower, more competitive rate.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe American Perceptions Initiative (API), a project of The Heritage Foundation, conducted a market research study of voters\u2019 familiarity, attitude, and perspectives on corporate tax reform. The market research also gauged their level of support and agreement with related messages and communications.\n\nThe American Perceptions Initiative\u2019s research is conducted in partnership with Vision Critical, Maru, and Heart+Mind Strategies, and is fielded online with the Springboard America platform.\n\nThe research specialists at Vision Critical help their commercial, government, media, and not-for-profit clients better understand their customers and stakeholders, covering subjects including public opinion, health, technology, consumer goods, media, and travel.\n\nMaru is an affiliated company incorporating the Springboard America platform, a high-quality panel of over 300,000 U.S. panelists.\n\nHeart+Mind Strategies is an experienced consulting firm specializing in winning the hearts and minds of the people that matter most to their clients\u2019 success.\n\nThe American Perceptions Initiative\u2019s study on corporate tax reform was conducted online from March 17\u201327, 2017, among 1,017 registered voters. A probability sample of the same size would have a margin of error of \u00b13.1 percent.\n\nPart I: The Landscape of Corporate Tax Reform\n\nHunger for Reform\n\nAmericans are united in their desire to see significant tax reform as in few other issues in this polarized political climate. The vast majority of Americans believe the federal tax system needs some change. Sixty-four percent believe it needs major changes and reform. Nine percent think it is working well in its present form. Although the desire for major reform is strongest among Republicans (71 percent), majorities of both Independents (67 percent) and Democrats (55 percent) also believe major change is needed.\n\nBeyond the simple desire for change, the details of tax reform are more complex. When given a list of potential issues that could motivate their political action, Americans put individual income tax reform at the top of the list (76 percent, very/one of the most influential)\u2014just behind health care. Corporate tax reform fell at the bottom (40 percent). While Americans are eager for changes to the part of the tax system that impact them most directly\u2014income tax\u2014they have less concern or even awareness over the business side of the equation.\n\nBoth types of reform are more important to Democrats, with 83 percent motivated by income tax reform and 46 percent motivated by corporate tax reform as an issue, than Republicans (71 percent and 35 percent, respectively) and Independents (72 percent and 37 percent, respectively), even though Democrats are less likely to believe changes are needed. Vague or general references to tax reform, being more salient to Democrats, may reinforce more liberal notions of reform.\n\nIndeed, there are some noticeable differences between how those of different political parties think about tax policy. For all Americans, \u201cstimulating investment and economic growth\u201d was considered the top goal of tax policy. However, while Republicans and Independents view paying for government as the second goal, Democrats consider redistributing wealth to fight income inequality equally important to stimulating growth, and more important than paying for government services.\n\nAll Americans are united in wanting reform, but their ideas of what reform will look like and what goals should shape it differ. However, most are motivated by stimulating economic growth.\n\nCorporate Tax Rates: Uncompetitive and Too High\n\nAlthough corporate tax reform may not be high on the public\u2019s agenda, it has an unquestionable impact on the economy and prosperity of all Americans. Already figuring prominently in President Trump\u2019s broader tax proposal, it is also likely to be a key feature in tax reform debates on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn anticipation of the issue heating up in 2017, a number of public opinion outlets have begun exploring the issue, usually reporting that Americans have one major complaint: the wealthy and corporations pay too little.\n\nAn April 2017 poll by Pew Research Center, conducted shortly before the release of the President\u2019s tax plan, found that: 54 percent say they pay the right amount in taxes; 27 percent are bothered \u201ca lot\u201d by the amount they pay in taxes; 60 percent are bothered \u201ca lot\u201d that wealthy people do not pay their fair share; and 62 percent are bothered \u201ca lot\u201d that some corporations do not pay their fair share.\n\nAt the same time, Americans are increasingly saying that the federal tax system is unfair: 56 percent not too/not at all fair, up from 48 percent in 2015.[REF]\n\nThe attitude is most prevalent among Democrats, with 75 percent bothered a lot. However, 40 percent of Republicans also agree. Americans are more unified in their lesser concerns over the complexity of the tax system (39 percent Democrat and 49 percent Republican), the amount they pay in taxes (21 percent Democrat and 35 percent Republican), and that some poor people do not pay their fair share (15 percent Democrat and 26 percent Republican).\n\nA study conducted by Gallup around the same time found similar results. Sixty-three percent think upper-income people pay too little and 67 percent think corporations pay too little.\n\nConcerns that middle-income Americans pay too much has risen since 2013, when 56 percent said they pay their fair share and only 36 percent thought they pay too much. Now, 51 percent think they pay too much.[REF]\n\nAmericans may be assumed to be reasonably familiar with what they pay in taxes\u2014if they look at their pay stubs or consider expected tax refunds or payments each April. However, few of these polls have explored Americans\u2019 familiarity with what others pay and what perceptions are driving concerns over the wealthy and corporations.\n\nAsking these questions reveals that Americans discontent with corporations is due more to unfamiliarity with the current tax system than reality. On average, Americans believe the combined federal and state corporate tax rate is 30 percent. The most common response when Americans guessed the corporate rate was 35 percent; however, many thought it was even lower\u201430 percent, 25 percent, 20 percent, and even 15 percent and 10 percent. In reality, the combined federal and state corporate tax rate is higher than they think at 39 percent.\n\nWhen Americans learn that the combined state and federal tax rate is actually 39 percent, far from worrying that corporations are not paying enough, 50 percent of Americans believe that rate is too high. Furthermore, Americans are sensitive to the globally uncompetitive nature of the U.S. system. Hence, when they learn that the U.S. has the highest rate in the developed world, the proportion who believes the rate is too high climbs to 67 percent, while only 7 percent would still say it is too low.\n\nThe consensus that rates are too high translates into policy. Similar proportions\u201454 percent of those who just learned the correct rate and 62 percent of those who also learned of other countries\u2019 rates\u2014would support lowering the corporate tax rate. Of those that would reduce the rate, 38 percent support reducing it a lot. The majority (55 percent) would prefer to reduce it a little, most likely to a level that more closely fits with their original estimate.\n\nTwo-thirds (68 percent) would also support cutting corporate tax rates to \u201cencourage businesses to stay in or come back to the U.S., bringing jobs and economic growth,\u201d while only 32 percent would choose to not cut corporate tax rates for fears that it would lead to program cuts or greater wealth inequality. A similar proportion (64 percent) believe corporate tax cuts are affordable by eliminating other forms of corporate welfare and stimulating economic growth.\n\nDemocrats were evenly divided between the perspectives, while jobs and economic growth appealed strongly to Republicans and Independents. However, all three parties (73 percent) agree that corporations make decisions on what is best for them, and nations must make their land an attractive place for businesses if they want companies to do business there.\n\nTop Motivators\n\nAmericans see promoting employment as the most important benefit of corporate tax reform, followed by improving economic growth and prosperity. Ensuring everyone pays their fair share comes in a close third, echoing themes noted by Gallup and Pew Research Center. What constitutes a \u201cfair share\u201d varies, and is arguably lower than the current rate according to most Americans.\n\nFurthermore, rating promoting employment and economic growth as important benefits of corporate tax reform is correlated to support for reducing rates. Americans who see the strong connection between these three issues are more likely to see a need to reduce business tax rates.\n\nAmericans believe corporate tax rates have a greater negative impact on workers and customers than on business owners or shareholders, who are the ones most directly impacted by those rates in reality. Americans rate the negative impact of federal corporate taxes on workers and consumers at approximately a 7 on a scale of 10, while they only rate the impact to business owners and shareholders at a 6.\n\nExplaining how these groups are impacted does not significantly change the degree of impact Americans see. In fact, describing decreased profits for business owners slightly decreases the degree of negative impact Americans see. Overall, impact to workers through jobs and consumers through possible increases in prices, as well as everyday Americans through the overall economy, resonates most with Americans.\n\nPart II: The Language of Corporate Tax Reform\n\nWorkers and Consumers\n\nThemes of workers, consumers, and economic growth are equally apparent in the language that resonates with Americans. Out of a number of different groups, workers and consumers are the only ones viewed very positively, with equity scores of 54 and 45 respectively. Businesses and shareholders elicit a more tepid positive response at 29 and 25, and corporations are neutral.[REF]\n\nWorkers and consumers also formed the center for messages drawing the highest agreement:\n\n\u201cConsumers ultimately pay for corporate taxes through higher prices\u201d: 87 percent agree.\n\n\u201cWorkers ultimately pay for corporate taxes through lower wages and lost jobs\u201d: 78 percent agree.\n\nOf these two strong themes, the connection to higher prices for consumers is more widely recognized, with 9 percent more Americans agreeing, and more strongly felt. Forty-four percent of Americans strongly agree that consumers pay through higher prices, compared to only 34 percent who strongly agree that workers pay through lower wages and lost jobs. The American Perceptions Initiative has identified this as the best overall message for its strong and broad support.\n\nBoth messages receive strong agreement across party lines, indicating the power of these themes to unify, connect, and draw broad support from Americans. Messages emphasizing the impact to workers were most likely to appeal to those who did not initially support lowering the corporate tax rates, but may be persuaded to. Eighteen percent of Americans said that the corporate tax rate was just right or too low, despite learning what the actual rate was, and did not support lowering it, but later agreed that the U.S. should cut corporate tax rates \u201cto encourage businesses to stay in or come back to the United States, bringing jobs and economic growth\u201d over concerns that a reduction would lead to cuts to government programs and higher wealth concentration. Among that 18 percent, 83 percent agreed that workers are negatively impacted through high rates\u2014a 5-point increase from the total. The American Perceptions Initiative has identified this as the best persuasive message for changing minds, where education on the actual rate and country comparisons fail to have an effect.\n\nGlobal Economy and the Tax Code\n\nAmericans recognize the competitive nature of the global economy. Countries compete with one another for business that provides jobs and taxable income to bolster their economies and bring greater prosperity. Hearing the U.S. rate compared to other similar countries is convincing in part because of this reality. In fact, 68 percent say the U.S. should lower rates to encourage businesses to stay in or come back to the country, bringing jobs and economic growth, over maintaining the current rates to prevent program cuts and wealth concentration.\n\nMoreover, Americans are aware that the economic conditions of a country profoundly affect a company\u2019s decision about where to locate. Seventy-three percent agree that corporations made decisions based on what is best for them, and a country\u2019s conditions should be made attractive to them to bring in business. Only 27 percent think that patriotic duty or loyalty will keep a company if it is profitable to operate elsewhere.\n\nOne of the highest messages tested tapped into this dynamic:\n\n\u201cHigh corporate tax rates encourage businesses to move their capital and jobs outside of the United States\u201d: 78 percent agree.\n\nHowever, this message was slightly more polarizing than other top messages, with a 15 point gap between Republican agreement (88 percent) and Democratic agreement (73 percent), with Independents in between (79 percent).\n\nThe polarization is more pronounced when the practical results are explored, with lowering overall agreement as one result:\n\n\u201cWith the highest corporate tax rate among developed countries, the U.S. can\u2019t compete with other countries for businesses and jobs\u201d: 68 percent agree.\n\nAgreement is slightly lower among even Republicans (79 percent), and Independents (71 percent). However, the partisan divide widens from 15 points to 19, with Democrats agreeing at only 60 percent.\n\nWhile Americans may largely agree in theory that high rates encourage businesses to move offshore, the practical implications on the U.S.\u2019s ability to compete in the world resonate more strongly among those on the right side of the political spectrum. The American Perceptions Initiative has designated this a strong base message, tapping into Republicans\u2019 more globally competitive values.\n\nPublic Perception of Corporations\n\nCorporations are made up of people\u2014the workers, the shareholders, and the owners. Economists are quick to recognize that businesses are complex human ecosystems with immense impact on the American economy and prosperity. Americans are more likely to see them as cold, impersonal entities, at odds with everyday Americans and their prosperity rather than entwined with them.\n\nAttempts to reveal the human side of corporations are met with strong opposition. Shareholders and owners, the human side of the corporation equation, meet with tepid responses. Shareholders elicited a 25 word equity score\u2014positive but barely out of the neutral range. A message stressing the impact to these individuals, \u201cCorporate taxes hurt business owners and shareholders by forcing them to give more of their profits to the government,\u201d received 63 percent agreement, and of that 63 percent, only 23 percent agreed strongly. The shareholders message was one of the lowest messages tested, higher only than a pro-corporate tax message.\n\nRemoved from their context, some common taglines aimed at highlighting this aspect of corporations did poorly as well.\n\n\u201cCorporations are people,\u201d a phrase Mitt Romney used with disastrous effect in his presidential run, received a slightly negative equity score of \u20137.\n\n\u201cPeople pay taxes, corporations do not\u201d received an even more negative score of \u201333.\n\nThe clearer \u201ccorporations are made up of people\u201d did better at +30, but still only had a somewhat positive impact.\n\nThose who would want to build support for lowering the corporate tax rate should focus on linking the effect of lower rates to already popular groups like workers and consumers rather than trying to humanize corporations against such opposition.\n\nPart III: Special Issues in Corporate Tax Reform\n\nDeductions, Credits, and Exclusions\n\nAmericans prefer eliminating most deductions, tax credits, and exclusions in exchange for lower rates (46 percent) to keeping them (26 percent) by almost two to one. However, more Americans say they are unsure which they would choose (28 percent) than would choose to keep them.\n\nCalling these items \u201ctax vs.\u201d slightly increases support for elimination to 51 percent, while support for retaining them drops off significantly to 12 percent. However, the proportion of unsure rises to 37 percent, suggesting that \u201ctax preferences\u201d is an unfamiliar and unclear way of referring to deductions and credits.\n\nDouble Taxation and Corporate Integration\n\nAmericans tend to oppose, albeit not strongly, double taxation of corporate earnings through corporate taxes and shareholders\u2019 capital gains taxes, when explained. A little over half (54 percent) view it negatively, saying it is either not a very good approach (38 percent) or a terrible approach (16 percent). Just under half (46 percent) consider it a either a good approach (39 percent) or an excellent approach (7 percent). While the proportion of those who consider it a good approach and a not very good approach is nearly evenly split, those who consider it a terrible approach outweighs those who consider it an excellent approach more than two to one. The term itself elicits a somewhat negative reaction at \u201337 word equity.\n\nAmericans are split (40 percent to 40 percent) on corporate integration\u2014the elimination of taxes at the corporate level in favor of taxation of profit only on the individual level to prevent double taxation. The opposition has a slightly stronger tone (17 percent strongly oppose while 11 percent strongly support).\n\nHowever, 20 percent of Americans are unsure about corporate integration, even after receiving an explanation of the proposal. Those that are unsure about corporate integration tend to be moderate in their overall attitudes towards tax reform, supporting minor changes more than major or no changes; somewhat rather than strongly supporting or opposing corporate tax rate reduction in equal numbers; and more likely to identify with no particular political party and no political ideology. The side of the debate that wins this audience will have the greater public opinion support.\n\nDynamic Scoring\n\nThe media and lawmakers often tout Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores of the impact of new laws to the existing federal budget as a sign of their feasibility. CBO scores are projections based off modeling the future impact of a proposed law. The models can be complex and differ in what and how they consider impact.\n\nOne possible variation on historic \u201cstatic\u201d modeling of tax reform policies involves dynamic scoring, adjusting the model to account for expected changes in the economy as a result of tax policy changes, which affect the income available to tax (among other considerations).\n\nWhen dynamic scoring is explained, Americans tend to support using it in CBO scoring for tax reform, with 54 percent to 66 percent preferring it, depending on the explanation given. The clearest and most credible explanation tested was a simple one: \u201cThe cost of reducing tax rates may be offset by positive growth in the economy, which in turn generates more tax revenue for the government.\u201d An even 66 percent supported this method.\n\nBorder Tax Adjustment\n\nWhen confronted with arguments for and against, Americans are split on the Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) as a measure that would tax goods imported to the U.S. while not taxing goods the U.S. exports to other countries.\n\nForty percent would oppose the BAT because it could have negative economic impact, increasing the price of imports and decreasing trade.\n\nThirty-six percent would support it as a way of raising revenue to support other business tax reforms.\n\nTwenty-four percent were neutral or unsure, even having received a description.\n\nRevenue Neutrality\n\nWithout hearing any description, 70 percent of Americans agree that reduction in corporate tax rates should be \u201crevenue neutral\u201d. Agreement is tepid and likely uncertain, with 51 percent saying they only somewhat agree, and just 19 percent strongly agreeing.\n\nHowever, when asked to choose between two perspectives on revenue neutrality, the percentage who agree that all changes to the tax code should be revenue neutral dips to 55 percent. Opposition to revenue neutrality grew by 15 points, with 45 percent agreeing with the perspective that revenue neutrality is a trap because it requires one man\u2019s tax cut to be offset by another\u2019s increase, keeping the tax burden on Americans and the economy the same.\n\nWhen given practical options of how to respond to the potential for lower federal income, support for revenue neutral measures drops further. Nearly half of Americans think tax cuts should be paid for through overall spending cuts (49 percent), while 23 percent think they should be made up in other taxes (23 percent). Another 19 percent think cuts should come specifically from entitlement reform to reduce the burden of the largest federal programs. Only 8 percent think tax cuts should lead to a higher deficit and more national debt.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmericans see a strong need to update the tax system with minor or even major reforms. However, most Americans think more of reform on the individual side than the business side. Moreover, Americans hold differing ideas of what reform should look like, and even the ultimate goal of tax policy as a whole.\n\nAlthough divided on specifics, Americans are united in their concern that corporate tax rates be competitive in the global economy and benefit workers and consumers domestically through job creation and low prices. Emphasizing these themes and educating Americans on the actual rates that currently burden businesses can help unify and build support for lower, more competitive rates.", "(AP) \u2014 France\u2019s foreign minister said Wednesday that chemical analysis of samples taken from a deadly sarin gas attack in Syria early April \u201cbears the signature\u201d of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government and shows it was responsible for the deadly assault.\n\nAccording to Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, France came to this conclusion after comparing samples from a sarin attack in Syria from 2013 that matched. The findings came in a report published Wednesday.\n\nThe Kremlin promptly denounced the French report, saying the samples and the fact the nerve agent was used are not enough to prove who was behind it.\n\nFrance knows \u201cfrom sure sources\u201d that \u201cthe manufacturing process of the sarin that was sampled is typical of the method developed in Syrian laboratories,\u201d Ayrault added. \u201cThis method bears the signature of the regime and that is what allows us to establish its responsibility in this attack.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s Foreign Ministry said that blood samples were taken from a victim in Syria on the day of the attack in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun on April 4 in which more than 80 people were killed.\n\nEnvironmental samples, the French ministry said, show the weapons were made \u201caccording to the same production process than the one used in the sarin attack perpetrated by the Syrian regime in Sarabeq.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s presidency said the country\u2019s intelligence services presented evidence which \u201cdemonstrate that the (Syrian) regime still holds chemical warfare agents, in violation of the commitments to eliminate them that it took in 2013.\u201d It says the information will be made public.\n\nIt\u2019s thought that Assad\u2019s government still has a stockpile hundreds of ton of chemical weapons despite saying it had handed over all of them.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia\u2019s position on the attack is \u201cunchanged\u201d and that \u201cthat the only way to establish the truth about what happened near Idlib is an impartial international investigation.\u201d\n\nRussia has previously urged for an international probe, and Peskov expressed regret that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has turned down the Syrian government\u2019s offers to visit the site of the attack and investigate.\n\nThe United States has also blame Assad\u2019s government for the April 4 attack in Khan Sheikhoun. The Trump administration fired cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase in retaliation for the attack and issued sanctions on 271 people linked to the Syrian agency said to be responsible for producing non-conventional weapons. Syria has strongly denied the accusations.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the airstrike that the U.S. launched at a Syrian military base in retaliation for the in Khan Sheikhoun attack damages the prospects of a political settlement for the war-torn country.\n\nLavrov told a security conference in Moscow the U.S. response \u201cpushes the prospect for a wide international front on terror even further away.\u201d\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia had to boost security measures at its air base in Syria after the U.S. airstrike. Russia has provided an air cover for the government\u2019s offensive on Islamic State militants.", "Catholic News Service reported on Friday that two Catholic leaders in Syria are criticizing the U.S. attack on the Bashar al-Assad regime that took place on Thursday, claiming it will only assure the continuation of the bloody civil war in the country, with Christians perhaps suffering the most.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that the United States administration didn\u2019t wait until an honest United Nations investigation was thoroughly made into what is said to be a chemical air strike in Khan Shaykun,\u201d Syriac Catholic Patriarch Ignace Joseph Younan told CNS.\n\n\u201cThe agglomerate media and the supremacist policy of the USA just want the killing and destroying conflict in Syria to continue, and this primarily to kill whatever attempt to resolve the bloody crisis,\u201d the Syrian-born Younan told CNS. Younan also served for fourteen years as bishop of the New Jersey-based Diocese of Our Lady of Deliverance for Syriac Catholics in the United States and Canada.\n\nBishop Georges Khazen, who serves Latin-rite Catholics in Aleppo, agreed that there should have been an investigation as to who perpetrated the chemical weapon attack before any military response, telling the Rome-based Fides news agency that the U.S. action \u201copens new disturbing scenarios for all.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed the launch of 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles on Thursday night as a retaliatory move following what appeared to be a chemical attack on civilians in Idlib province.\n\n\u201cThe strikes were intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again,\u201d Pentagon Spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said.\n\nDavis said the strikes hit aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers, and air defense systems and radars.\n\nIn a speech explaining his actions, Trump said, in part:\n\nTonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where a chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital, national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council. We ask for God\u2019s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed, and we hope that as long as America stands for justice, that peace and harmony will in the end prevail.\n\nThe criticism by Christians of the U.S. attack against the Assad regime reflects the complicated lives of believers in Syria and the contrast of their lives before and since the civil war.\n\nIn December 2016, the Economist wrote about Christians caught in the civil war in Syria, now entering its seventh year, in an article entitled, \u201cAleppo presents a moral dilemma for Christian leaders\u201d:\n\nThe leaders of Syria\u2019s local churches have generally looked to President Bashar al-Assad as their protector; and their feeling that only Mr Assad guarantees their lives has deepened as the conflict has polarized, with fundamentalist Sunni fighters, murderously hostile to all other faiths, on one side and government forces backed by Shia militias and Russian air power on the other. In this state of affairs, only the latter coalition seems to offer Christian churches any chance of prolonging their precarious existence. Many would say Mr Assad is to blame for bringing about that polarization; but to a bishop on Syria\u2019s front-line, survival probably matters more than political analysis. To defend Mr. Assad seems morally outrageous, but calls for his removal risk sounding like a death-knell for fellow Christians.\n\nThe Economist cited Father Jacques Mourad who survived five months of captivity at the hands of Islamic terrorists. He said that, while \u201cSunni extremism\u201d is a threat to Christians, they are not the only threat.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has been bombing Syria and Iraq for years, and now the Russians are doing so, too,\u201d Mourad said. \u201cAnd what have they achieved? Have they stopped the terrorist violence?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mourad said.\n\nThe BBC provided a backdrop for the Christian dilemma in an article it published in February 2015.\n\nThe founder of the Baath Party, which has ruled Syria since 1963, was a Christian, and Christians rose to senior positions in the party, government and security forces, although they are generally not seen to have any real power compared with their Alawite and Sunni colleagues. Although, like other Syrians, they had very limited civil and political freedoms, Christians are believed to have valued the rights and protection accorded to minorities by Hafez al-Assad, who was president between 1971 and 2000, and by his son Bashar.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Patriarch Gregorios III Laham sent a statement to a Catholic charity saying, \u201cThe future of Christians in Syria is threatened not by Muslims but by\u2026 chaos\u2026 and the infiltration of uncontrollable fanatical, fundamentalist groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatriarch Gregorios said the threat to Christianity in Syria had wider implications for the religion\u2019s future in the Middle East because the country had for decades provided a refuge for Christians from neighboring Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere,\u201d the BBC reported.\n\nStill, there is no guarantee of the survival of Christianity in the cradle of the faith.\n\nOne year ago, Chaldean bishop of Aleppo, Antoine Audo, said that the Christian population in Syria has been reduced by two-thirds in five years \u2014 from 1.5 million to only 500,000.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the UN headquarters in Geneva, Audo said that the situation in Aleppo is even worse than in the rest of Syria where the Christian population had fallen from 160,000 to 40,000.", "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2013Democratic lawmakers have responded with mixed reactions to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to carry out military strikes on a Syrian air base that was the site of a chemical attack on Syrian civilians this week.\n\nApproximately 59 Tomahawk missiles targeted Shayrat Airfield near the Syrian city of Homs.\n\n\u201cI support the administration\u2019s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack.

Many of the victims included small children.\n\nPart of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement read, \u201cTonight\u2019s strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons.\u201d She also sounded off on the president\u2019s decision to proceed without Congress, saying, \u201cIf the President intends to escalate the U.S. military\u2019s involvement in Syria, he must come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another open-ended war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a follow-up letter, she implored House Speaker Paul Ryan to \u201ccall the House back in session immediately to debate any decision to place our men and women in uniform in harm\u2019s way.\u201d She added, \u201cAs heartbreaking as Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attacks on his own people was, the crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan called the strikes \u201cappropriate and just\u201c:\n\nEarlier this week the Assad regime murdered dozens of innocent men, women, and children in a barbaric chemical weapons attack. Tonight the United States responded. This action was appropriate and just. These tactical strikes make clear that the Assad regime can no longer count on American inaction as it carries out atrocities against the Syrian people. Resolving the years-long crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort.\n\nWhile the strikes were lauded as a stark change from six years of inaction on Syria under former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, some Americans expressed opposition to the move fearing it might provoke another ground war.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) said, \u201cIt angers and saddens me that President Trump has taken the advice of war hawks and escalated our illegal regime change war to overthrow the Syrian government.\u201d She added, \u201cThis escalation is short-sighted and will lead to more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia\u2014which could lead to nuclear war.\u201d\n\nProgressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) used the occasion to push for greater admittance of Syrian refugees into the United States. \u201cThe Syrian regime must be held accountable for this horrific act, and its actions underscore why the United States should embrace innocent people who are fleeing in terror.\u201d\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.", "LUCCA, Italy (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Group of Seven meeting of foreign ministers from industrialized nations (all times local):\n\n5:00 p.m.\n\nGroup of Seven foreign ministers are sitting down in Italy for their first roundtable session at a meeting dominated by Syria\u2019s civil war and Russia\u2019s role in it.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano greeted U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the other G-7 diplomats as they arrived Monday at the centuries-old Ducal Palace in the Tuscan city of Lucca.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Italy, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Canada then sat around a table to begin their talks.\n\nTillerson is due to travel to Moscow after the two-day G-7 meeting, and the group hopes to send a unified message that Russia must end its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad in the wake of a deadly chemical weapons attack last week.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says the group will discuss imposing new sanctions on Syrian military figures and Russian military individuals responsible for backing them.\n\n\u2014\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says Group of Seven foreign ministers are considering imposing new sanctions on Russian individuals over Moscow\u2019s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nJohnson says ministers meeting in Lucca, Italy on Monday and Tuesday \u201cwill be discussing the possibility of further sanctions, certainly, on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures.\u201d\n\nThe G-7 foreign ministers are discussing their response to last week\u2019s chemical attack in Syria, which the West blames on Assad\u2019s forces \u2013 and by extension its Russian backers.\n\nBritain has been among those calling most strongly for a tough new approach to Russia.\n\n\u2014\n\n8:23 a.m.\n\nForeign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations are gathering for a meeting given urgency by the chemical attack in Syria and the U.S. military response.\n\nThe meeting in the Tuscan walled city of Lucca that starts Monday aims to pressure Russia to end its support for President Bashar Assad.\n\nLast week\u2019s nerve gas attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people stirred President Donald Trump to strike for the first time at Assad\u2019s forces.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano says Europe\u2019s broad support for the U.S. military strikes contributed to a \u201crenewed harmony\u201d between the United States and its partners.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is attending the first meeting of G-7 foreign ministers since Donald Trump took office.", "The U.S. and Russia have been trading barbs since President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on the Assad regime\u2019s military assets in Syria last week, but now Russian President Vladimir Putin has closed the door on a face-to-face meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when the U.S. top diplomat visits the country later this week.\n\nRussia has long supported Syrian President Bashar Assad and refutes the U.S. claim that the dictator ordered the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed innocent people, including many children.\n\n\u201cWe have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president\u2019s diary,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a Monday press conference call, according to Reuters.\n\nBefore Tillerson became Secretary of State, he was the CEO of ExxonMobil, a job that included dealings with the Kremlin. In 2013, Putin presented Tillerson with the Russian Order of Friendship award.\n\nTillerson is expected to meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during his stop in Moscow, according to Reuters.\n\nReuters reported that Putin regularly met with John Kerry, Secretary of State under Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cReacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to stop supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia\u2019s closet Middle East ally, Peskov called that a non-starter,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cReturning to pseudo-attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nOther thorny issues may surface during Tillerson\u2019s visit to Moscow, including Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, its violation of an arms control treaty, and finding common ground on fighting radical Islamic terrorism in Syria.\n\nTillerson had some tough words for Russia on Thursday about the chemical weapons attack.\n\nSpeaking from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where Trump was meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson cited Russia\u2019s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical stockpile, saying Russia has \u201cclearly failed in its responsibility\u201d to eliminate those weapons.\n\n\u201cEither Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,\u201d Tillerson said.\n\nU.S. military officials have said they are certain Assad is responsible for the attack.\n\n\u201cWe highly suspect, and in fact, there\u2019s no credible alternative to a Syrian regime air attack as the source of the chemicals that killed so many Syrian civilians,\u201d a military official said.\n\n\u201cISIS has experimented with mustard agents, blister agents, not nerve agents,\u201d an official said. \u201cBut this is well beyond the technical capability of the opposition.\u201d", "Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s credibility suffered a blow in the G7 after proposals to levy targeted sanctions on senior Russian and Syrian figures were rejected.\n\nGermany and Italy vetoed the idea, believing that tensions should not be escalated until an investigation into the gas incident in Idlib, Syria, has been completed, according to The Telegraph.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano insisted that \u201cwe must have a dialogue with Russia and we must not push Russia into a corner\u201d, suggesting President Vladimir Putin would have to be involved in any process designed to remove Bashar al-Assad from power in Syria.\n\nForeign ministers from the U.S., UK, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Canada are said to have agreed that President Assad had no future as head of state, but no timetable for his removal was established.\n\nThey were also unclear on how an \u201con the ground\u201d investigation acceptable to all parties could be arranged.\n\nJohnson claimed his proposals \u201chad a wide degree of acceptance \u2026 but you\u2019ve got to do these things in the proper, legal way\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, he claimed: \u201cWhat I think we all want to see is Russia engaging with a political process that involves a transition to a new government in Syria.

It has adherents across Europe and the Muslim world. In my opinion, that ISIS is the primary threat to us, because it has found ways to deftly pump out Sunni jihadist ideology that inspires and gives permission to those Muslims on the fringes of society who feel humiliated \u2014 from London to Paris to Cairo \u2014 to recover their dignity via headline-grabbing murders of innocents. The other incarnation is \u201cterritorial ISIS.\u201d It still controls pockets in western Iraq and larger sectors of Syria. Its goal is to defeat Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria \u2014 plus its Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah allies \u2014 and to defeat the pro-Iranian Shiite regime in Iraq, replacing both with a caliphate.\n\nRegarding the fight against what Friedman calls \u201cterritorial ISIS,\u201d the columnist suggests a dramatic increase in U.S. military aid to anti-Assad rebels. Another option Friedman suggests is that \u201cWe could simply back off fighting territorial ISIS in Syria and make it entirely a problem for Iran, Russia, Hezbollah and Assad.\u201d\n\nIn response to the column, the Jerusalem Post\u2019s oped editor Seth Frantzman, who has traveled to Iraq on a number of occasions and witnessed the destruction wrought by IS firsthand, ripped the column to pieces, not only for being \u201csick and twisted\u201d and \u201cimmoral,\u201d but also for allegedly spreading falsehoods.\n\nFriedman\u2019s claim that IS\u2019s \u201cgoal is to defeat Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria \u2014 plus its Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah allies\u201d is \u201csimply not true,\u201d according to Frantzman, who penned the response on his personal website.\n\n\u201cThe main group ISIS is fighting in Syria is the SDF and YPG, the Kurdish and allied forces who have been fighting ISIS for more than two and a half years,\u201d writes Frantzman. \u201cU.S. forces, including Rangers and Marines, are working closely with the Kurds to defeat ISIS and Friedman ignores them in his fantasy that ISIS is fighting Syria and Iran, Russia and Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nFriedman\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. allow IS to \u201cbleed\u201d Assad, Russia and Iran, just as the mujahedeen bled Russia in Afghanistan, prompts Frantzman to denounce the Times as irresponsible.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this appeared in a major mainstream newspaper, it is even harder to believe it appeared in the New York Times. Of all the groups in the world to argue for letting it be someone else\u2019s problem, why would ISIS, after its years of genocidal crimes, be let off the hook? Why would anyone claim that \u201cwe\u201d should even encourage it the way the US encouraged the mujahedeen in Afghanistan? Hasn\u2019t anyone learned that the tragedy of Afghanistan was partly because of US support, and then walking away, from the mujahedeen and allowing the Taliban to take over Afghanistan? Hasn\u2019t anyone learned that working with jihadists and extremists doesn\u2019t work? And why choose the worst of the worst? ISIS isn\u2019t \u201cmoderate\u201d Islamism, it isn\u2019t the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas, it isn\u2019t even Nusra Front (Al Qaeda in Syria), it is even more extreme. ISIS murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Has everyone forgotten? Have they forgotten that ISIS burned people to death? It beheaded and murdered 1,700 people at Camp Speicher in Iraq.\n\nFinally, in a Facebook post accompanying his article, Frantzman writes, \u201cISIS has empowered Assad, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, it isn\u2019t \u2018bleeding\u2019 them. If you care about human rights, if you care about anything, you must oppose this dangerous, cynical and disturbing column.\n\n\u201cFriedman may be a senior columnist, but this should never have made it past his editor.\u201d", "(AFP) \u2013 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s comments that last week\u2019s chemical weapons attack was a fabrication to justify a US military strike are \u201c100 percent lies\u201d, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent lies and propaganda,\u201d Ayrault said during a visit to Beijing, responding to an exclusive AFP interview with Assad on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent cruelty and cynicism.\u201d\n\nThe French minister mirrored language used by Assad himself, who dismissed the allegation that his regime perpetrated the attack that left 87 civilians dead, including many children.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, 100 percent for us, it\u2019s fabrication,\u201d Assad said in the interview.\n\nThe Syrian leader questioned whether the attack had in fact occurred, claiming that \u201cfake videos\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d were being used against his government.\n\nHe also accused the United States of colluding with terrorists and \u201cfabricating the whole story in order to have a pretext\u201d for a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base last week.\n\nThe French minister made the remarks during a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that more than 300,000 have died, 11 million people have been displaced or become refugees, tens of thousands have been placed in Syrian prisons and a country has been destroyed,\u201d Ayrault said.\n\n\u201cThat is the reality. It is not a fantasy.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the need for an end to the conflict with a \u201creal ceasefire, one which restricts the Syrian air force and military and is upheld by the international community.\u201d\n\nAyrault praised China\u2019s role in the matter, noting its abstention from a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution to condemn the Syrian gas attack.\n\nIn the past, China has voted alongside Russia to veto UN resolutions on the Syrian conflict.\n\nWang expressed his agreement with the French minister, noting that an \u201cindependent, fair and professional investigation\u201d into the chemical weapons attack should be conducted \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d", "Donald Trump is turning into David Cameron \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean this as a compliment.\n\nDavid Cameron had some pretty stiff competition in the field of Most Awful British Prime Minister of the Last 20 Years. But at least his rivals \u2013 the dour, incompetent Socialist Gordon Brown and the venal and slippery warmonger Tony Blair \u2013 campaigned on a Labour party ticket. Cameron, on the other hand, campaigned as a Conservative. And there\u2019s really nothing more despicable than a politician who betrays his own voter base in order to position himself as a mainstream centrist.\n\nThis is what David Cameron did, throughout his two terms as Prime Minister. To anyone of a genuinely conservative disposition he was a massive disappointment: on his watch, the police and justice system grew more politically correct, the minimum wage rose, Keynesian deficit spending continued to flourish, green policies proliferated, defence spending was cut while foreign aid was increased \u2013 delighting the kind of people who believe that conservatism is heartless and evil, but infuriating those who understand that it\u2019s about hard but fair decisions taken for the long term benefit of all.\n\nCameron\u2019s fundamental problem was that he wasn\u2019t ideological. He believed \u2013 like Bismarck, like Tony Blair, unlike Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan \u2013 that politics is the art of the possible. He wanted to be liked much more than he wanted to do the right thing. He was more interested in what his hero Tony Blair called \u201ceye-catching initiatives\u201d \u2013 ie meaningless gestures like his doomed schemes to create a \u201cBig Society\u201d and to lead \u201cthe Greenest Government Ever\u201d \u2013 than doing hard stuff that needed to be done like reducing government spending or reforming the National Health Service.\n\nClearly, it is far too early to say whether Donald Trump will prove as big a letdown as David Cameron. But there are a few similarities which should worry us: those of us, at least, who had hoped \u2013 and still hope \u2013 he was going to be a radical president who would drain the swamp and act in the interests of his people rather than merely pander to the establishment elite.\n\nOne is his cronyism. With Cameron, this mainly took the form of filling his inner circle with people who\u2019d shared his privileged education at Eton or at least were rich enough to own lovely expensive homes in Notting Hill. With Trump it\u2019s his family. When America voted Trump it didn\u2019t mean Ivanka. Still less did it mean the immaculately liberal Jared Kushner, a Democrat whose influence sometimes seems so dominant you almost wonder why everyone didn\u2019t just give up and vote Hillary, for all the difference it would have made.\n\nAnother is his apparent willingness to sell out to the system. Trump had one point of appeal above all: that he wasn\u2019t part of the system. That\u2019s why he galvanised the Republican voter base in the way that none of the other candidates could. People saw him as the anti-Establishment candidate whom they could trust would never be bought. But, as Peter Schweizer noted on Breitbart News Daily, he has a funny way of showing it. What exactly are all these Goldman-Sachsers doing so close to the Administration? Isn\u2019t the Vampire Squid one of the biggest, ugliest creatures in the swamp Trump was supposed to drain?\n\nAll this would yet be fine, of course, if Trump were to heed the countervailing voices of the true ideologues in his Administration: the ones who get what needs to be done and who understand the need of the core vote. This is what\u2019s so worrying about the alleged sidelining of Steve Bannon. Trump should be aware of the worrying precedent here, which didn\u2019t end at all well for David Cameron. One of the few genuine conservative thinkers in Cameron\u2019s government was his Education Secretary Michael Gove, whose radical reforms to the sclerotic education system were hugely unpopular with the teachers\u2019 unions, the left generally and its propagandists at the BBC, but which had a transformative effect on the quality of Britain\u2019s schools.\n\nBut Cameron \u2013 always more interested in headlines than real achievements \u2013 ditched Gove after being told by an advisor that Gove\u2019s hardline policies and unapologetic conservatism were considered toxic by mainstream opinion. Later, this grave mistake proved Cameron\u2019s undoing: in the Brexit campaign, during which he had counted on Gove\u2019s support in backing Remain, he was appalled to find Gove fighting for Leave instead. This is one of the reasons why Cameron lost the Referendum and why his period as prime minister ended in such spectacular failure. It\u2019s a lesson that Trump would do well to learn before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s that unfortunate business in Syria recently \u2013 which many of those of us who rooted for Trump find deeply troubling.\n\nAnn Coulter set out the case against very well in her superb and witty Breitbart diatribe \u2013 Lassie Come Home!\n\nWar is like crack for presidents. It confers instant gravitas, catapulting them to respectability, bypassing all station stops. They get to make macho pronouncements on a topic where every utterance is seen as august. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s Syrian misadventure is immoral, violates every promise he ran on, and could sink his presidency.\n\nYes, quite. Cameron made precisely the same mistake in Libya when he set in motion the allied bombing campaign which eventually led to the deposition and death of Gadaffi. Sure Gadaffi was a terrible guy with blood on his hands. But from a Western security point of view \u2013 which ought, surely, to be the main priority of US military intervention \u2013 ousting him was a disaster. The warring Islamist factions which replaced Gadaffi are infinitely more dangerous to Western interests: as Ambassador Chris Stevens discovered to his cost in Benghazi.\n\nHow can President Trump, who previously knew all this stuff, suddenly not know it? Why is this non-Establishment free spirit suddenly enacting the kind of foreign policy one would fully have expected from President Hillary Clinton? How is this what America voted for?\n\nThe best complexion one can put all this is that the Tomahawk attack, like the dropping of the MOAB on Islamic State in Afghanistan, and like the sending of the fleet in the direction of North Korea are just a case of muscle flexing, reminding the world who is boss after a disastrous presidency under a man who had no faith in American exceptionalism and who seemed determined to show only weakness to the Muslim world.\n\nWell if that\u2019s the aim, fine. Certainly we mustn\u2019t give up hope yet.\n\nBut I have to say, on a personal note, as an Englishman who has taken an awful lot of flak back home for his support of President Trump, I\u2019m starting to get a little nervous.\n\nIn fact, in a few days I have to speak in a debate in defence of Trump and his first 100 days. My original plan was to hail him as the populist revolutionary who was finally going to free us all from the shackles of a corrupt, overweening and entrenched liberal elite. But the way things are going, I may have to adjust my position slightly. C\u2019mon Mister President. Cut me some slack here. Please don\u2019t let my best defense be: \u201cWell at least he\u2019s not quite as bad as Barack Obama.\u201d", "A Donald Trump presidency \u201cmight make the world ironically safer\u201d, according to the former head of the UK Armed Forces.\n\nIn an interview with House magazine, Lord Richards of Herstmonceux \u2013 the former Chief of the Defence staff \u2013 said Mr. Trump is \u201cwise enough to get good people round him and probably knows that he\u2019s got to listen to them and therefore I think we should not automatically think it will be less safe\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s non-state actors like Isis that are the biggest threat to our security. If countries and states could coalesce better to deal with these people \u2013 and I think Trump\u2019s instinct is to go down that route \u2013 then I think there\u2019s the case for saying that the world certainly won\u2019t be any less safe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that lack of understanding and empathy with each other as big power players that is a risk to us all at the moment.\n\n\u201cTherefore I think he would reinvigorate big power relationships, which might make the world ironically safer.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview Lord Richards also discussed the somewhat controversial view that the West should partner with Russia and Bashar al-Assad to take back the Syrian city of Aleppo.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf the humanitarian situation in Syria is our major concern, which it should be \u2013 millions of lives have been ruined, hundreds of thousands have been killed \u2013 I believe there is a strong case for allowing Assad to get in there and take the city back.\n\n\u201cThe opposition groups \u2013 many of whom are not friends of ours, they\u2019re extremists \u2013 are now intermingled with the original good opposition groups, are fighting from amongst the people. The only quick way of solving it is to allow Assad to win. There\u2019s no way the opposition groups are going to win.\u201d\n\nLord Richards added: \u201cWe want the humanitarian horror of Aleppo to come to a rapid halt. The best and quickest way of doing that is to encourage the opposition groups to leave. The Russians are undoubtedly using their weapons indiscriminately. If they\u2019re going to attack those groups then there is inevitably going to be civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cThe alternative is for the West to declare a no-fly zone and that means you\u2019ve got to be prepared to go to war with Russia ultimately. I see no appetite for that and nor, frankly, do I see much sense in it. It sticks in my throat to say it because I have no love for Assad.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the only way to get it to stop now is to allow Assad to win and win quickly and then turn on Isis with the Russians.\u201d", "TEL AVIV \u2013 The Israeli Air Force killed the members of a terrorist cell affiliated with the Islamic State in southern Syria in the first direct clash between Israel and the radical group Sunday morning.\n\nShots and a mortar shell were fired across the border at an IDF patrol on the Israeli side of the Golan Heights from the IS-affiliated Shuhada al-Yarmouk (Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade), according to an IDF statement.\n\nThe soldiers returned fire until an IAF aircraft struck an armed vehicle, killing four terrorists inside.\n\nThere were no reports of injury to the Israeli soldiers.\n\nMaj.-Gen. (ret.)

Spontaneous cries of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (our God is the greatest) and \u201cfree Syria\u201d emanated from the crowd as verses from the Koran read out in prayer.\n\nSome Muslims attendees bowed down to pray in the open spaces along the route, which ran from Marble Arch, along Oxford Street, onto Regent Street and Pall Mall and finally along White Hall to finish outside the gates to Downing Street. A rolling road block was put in place to facilitate the event.\n\nOutside the nearby Houses of Parliament, doctors and nurses staged a \u2018die-in\u2019 to highlight the effect the war is having on medical staff in the region.\n\nIn a statement posted on the event\u2019s Facebook page, organisers the Syria Solidarity Campaign said that Eastern Aleppo was now \u201con the verge\u201d of falling to Assad.\n\n\u201cReports estimate about 98% of Eastern Aleppo is now under the control of the Assad regime and its allies,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe urgently ask you to march with us this Saturday to show our extreme rage about the complete inaction of the international community in the face of catastrophic bombings in Aleppo.\u201d\n\nLikening the bombing of the city to a \u201cholocaust\u201d, the organisers added: \u201cwe urgently need the international community to take action to save lives.\n\n\u201cToday it is Aleppo, but tomorrow the same thing may happen in Idlib and other cities in Syria. We must push the international community to put an end to the atrocities.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has in the last few days confirmed that the Russian and Iranian-backed Syrian forces will continue their onslaught after pushing rebels outside of the city.\n\nSpeaking to the Kremlin\u2019s Russia 24 and NTV news channels, Assad said: \u201cThere will be no pause, because this only happens in an area in which terrorists say that they are prepared to hand in their weapons or leave the area. Only then, military operations stop. Operations do not stop during negotiations, because we do not trust the terrorists, because they often say something and do the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe Assad regime designated all rebels as terrorists at the start of the war, five years ago.\n\nThe protest comes on the same day that hundreds of British Muslims gathered outside the Syrian embassy in London\u2019s Belgrave Square to demand a Caliphate.\n\nAll photos: Rachel Megawhat / Breitbart London", "On Wednesday\u2019s episode of Whatever It Takes on the Breitbart News Network, Breitbart\u2019s lead investigative reporter Lee Stranahan and host Curt Schilling attacked the establishment media\u2019s coverage of the Syrian Civil War, saying the press was covering up the facts that the \u201crebels\u201d fighting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad consist largely of jihadists, some connected to terrorist group al-Qaeda.\n\nAs Assad\u2019s forces and his Russian and Iranian allies have achieved a major victory over the \u201crebels\u201d in the Northern city of Aleppo last week, Stranahan told Schilling that the major force battling Assad in Aleppo was a force called the Army of Conquest.\n\nIsrael National News reported on Wednesday a deal that allowed \u201ccivilians and moderate rebels with light weapons will be granted safe passage\u201d out of Eastern Aleppo, an area held by the Army of Conquest after the group announced a new siege on Aleppo back in August.\n\n\u2026the deal stipulated that those leaving would go to the northwest province of Idlib, almost completely controlled by a powerful rebel alliance known as the Army of Conquest. The \u201cArmy of Conquest\u201d is a coalition of rebels and jihadists including the former Al-Nusra Front formed this past August.\n\nStranahan pointed out that the establishment has done almost no reporting on who actually makes up the Army of Conquest or their Sunni Islamist ideology\n\nAsked who was backing the Army of Conquest, Stranahan said, \u201cThe United States of America and Saudi Arabia. We\u2019re backing the jihadists. And this is what we\u2019ve done consistently.\u201d\n\nStranahan explained how during the Arab Spring, the Obama administration had supported other Middle Eastern groups that supported strict Sharia law, using Egypt as an example, saying that under Obama, American foreign policy \u201csupported Hosni Mubarak leaving. We helped get Hosni Mubarak out of there, and then immediately he was replaced by the Muslim Brotherhood, who inserted Sharia law. Now, the Egyptian people didn\u2019t want that and so they got rid of the Muslim Brotherhood in fairly short order. But that\u2019s what happened, and we supported the people supporting Sharia law.\u201d\n\nCriticizing the conflicting policies of the Obama administration claiming to fight a war on terror while supporting Islamist groups, Stranahan said, \u201cthis is the schizophrenia we have. Hopefully the Trump administration is going to end once and for all.\u201d\n\nStranahan also said he found of the timing of allegations of Russia \u201chacking the elections\u201d suspicious, coming at the same time and from the same people who have supported the jihadists in Syria and who have connections to Saudi Arabia. Stranahan said:\n\nThe week that Aleppo is falling, and that Assad is winning, what happens? The CIA, who trained these forces, comes out with a secret report about Russia hacking the election. Hillary Clinton\u2014who\u2019s supported by Saudi Arabia\u2014comes out with a press conference. And who among the Republicans jumps in front of this train and says \u2018Yes, we have to have investigations into the Russians?\u2019 John McCain.\n\nIn response to a question from Schilling about the United State\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia, Stranahan brought up the Kingdom\u2019s deep financial ties, saying \u201cThis goes back to the Nixon administration, when American was in the middle of the oil crisis, when people were standing in line to get gasoline. We sent (Treasury Secretary) William Simon over there, and he negotiated a deal.\u201d\n\nStranahan cited a May, 2016 article in Bloomberg titled The Untold Story Behind Saudi Arabia\u2019s 41-Year U.S. Debt Secret that gave details for the first time about history of the deal.\n\nSimon, better than anyone else, understood the appeal of U.S. government debt and how to sell the Saudis on the idea that America was the safest place to park their petrodollars. With that knowledge, the administration hatched an unprecedented do-or-die plan that would come to influence just about every aspect of U.S.-Saudi relations over the next four decades.\n\nThe holdings in treasuries created by that decades-old deal are significant. As the Bloomberg article said:\n\nIn response to a Freedom-of-Information-Act request submitted by Bloomberg News, the Treasury broke out Saudi Arabia\u2019s holdings for the first time this month after \u201cconcluding that it was consistent with transparency and the law to disclose the data,\u201d according to spokeswoman Whitney Smith. The $117 billion trove makes the kingdom one of America\u2019s largest foreign creditors. Yet in many ways, the information has raised more questions than it has answered. A former Treasury official, who specialized in central bank reserves and asked not to be identified, says the official figure vastly understates Saudi Arabia\u2019s investments in U.S. government debt, which may be double or more.\n\nLISTEN:", "Some migrants coming into Western states as Syrian asylum seekers are \u201cdefinitely\u201d terrorists, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said.\n\nTerrorists pictured on the internet \u201cholding machine guns or killing people\u201d have since turned up in photographs of \u201cpeaceful refugees in Europe or the West\u201d, President Assad told Yahoo News, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nBut he declined to put a figure on how many of the 4.8 million asylum seekers might be terrorists, saying \u201cnobody has any number. Nobody knows. Because nobody knows all the terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe also declined to say whether the figure might be \u201csignificant\u201d, highlighting that it took only 15 people to bring down the Twin Towers on 9/11. \u201cIt\u2019s not about significant because you don\u2019t need a significant number to commit atrocities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the number, it\u2019s about the quality \u2013 it\u2019s about the intentions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in his presidential office in Damascus, Syria, Assad would not take a view on whether the U.S. was right to halt the immigration of migrants from seven countries which posed a security threat, Syria included, but said that his priority was rather to ensure that Syrian asylum seekers return home.\n\n\u201cFor me, the priority is to bring those citizens to their country, not to help them immigrate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe interview was released as the British prime minister, Theresa May, defended government schemes to resettle 20,000 Syrians in the UK over five years.\n\nAt a Downing Street press conference, May told reporters: \u2018We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria \u2013 a commitment of \u00a32.3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor.\u201d\n\nIn the last few days, the government has come under fire for ending a scheme to bring child migrants from Calais into Britain. Announcing the decision, immigration minister Robert Goodwill told MPs that 200 children had been placed around the country and that councils had indicated they had the capacity for only 150 more.\n\nBut the Archbishop of Canterbury slammed the move, calling on the government to take in nearly ten times as many children. He added: \u201cI fear that this week\u2019s decision does not meet the spirit of commitment that was given during the passage of the Immigration Act last year.\u201d", "America\u2019s United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters Wednesday that, while she supported peace talks for all sides of the Syrian civil war, the United States believed it imperative to \u201cget Iran and their proxies\u201d out of the country to maintain longstanding peace.\n\n\u201cThe United States absolutely supports [UN special envoy on Syria] Staffan de Mistura and the work that he\u2019s doing,\u201d she told reporters, referring to the announcement of a new round of peace talks. \u201cWe support the U.N. process, we support the talks in Geneva, we want to see them continue.\u201d\n\nHaley added, however, that a peaceful political solution would require both Sunni groups like the Islamic State and Shiite groups like Hezbollah to leave Syria. \u201cThis is very much about a political solution now\u2026 and that basically means that Syria can no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, we\u2019ve got to make sure we get Iran and their proxies out,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that, as we move forward, we\u2019re securing the borders for our allies as well.\u201d\n\nIran and Russia are the most prominent international allies of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who has eagerly welcomed their aid in crushing Syrian rebel opposition in areas like Aleppo, where the Islamic State never established itself. As of November 2016, Iranian officials estimated that over one thousand Iranian Shiite troops had died fighting for Assad. Reports at the time indicated that as many as 3,000 fighters allied with Assad in Syria were either Iranian fighters or allied with Iran. Assad also enjoys support from the Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah, which cooperates closely with the Iranian government.\n\nIran has also deployed its Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to aid Syrian troops, who have benefitted from protecting Assad with lucrative business investment deals throughout the parts of the country Assad still controls.\n\nIn addition to its official presence in Syria and that of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, Iran has forced Afghan refugees and Pakistani recruits to join the Syrian army in eradicating elements of the anti-Assad opposition, to the tune of an estimated 25,000 Shiite fighters as of November.\n\nThe United States has repeatedly objected to Assad\u2019s stance against rebels in the Syrian war, as well as Iran\u2019s and Russia\u2019s involvement. Last year, then-President Barack Obama warned that all three countries had \u201cblood on their hands\u201d following the siege and reconquest of Aleppo, a key victory for Assad in the Syrian Civil War. The Obama administration did little to intervene, however, establishing a failed militia of \u201cvetted\u201d Syrian rebels and failing to challenge Assad on his alleged use of chemical weapons.\n\nIn addition to Haley\u2019s challenge to Iran at the United Nations, the Trump administration announced this week that up to 400 Marines would enter the fray outside Raqqa, the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Islamic State caliphate. The Marines are expected to use artillery guns to open the way for anti-ISIS Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) troops, a coalition of Kurdish and Arabic militias.\n\nMeanwhile, de Mistura continues to work to schedule a fifth round of peace talks between Damascus and some elements of the Syrian opposition. \u201cMy current intention is to bring the invitees back to Geneva for a fifth round, with a target date of the 23rd of March,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. While multiple Arab opposition groups will participate, terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda are not invited.\n\nAnother round of \u201cpeace talks\u201d may begin a week earlier, as the nation of Kazakhstan announced a second summit of nations involved in the Syrian fray. Russia, Iran, Assad government representatives, Jordan, the United States, and Turkey are expected to participate, as they did during the first Astana talks. \u201cThe guarantor countries expect that the Syrian government and the armed opposition groups will confirm their delegations\u2019 participation in the gathering,\u201d Astana announced in a statement.\n\nThe United States did not participate officially in the first Astana talks, sending the American ambassador to Kazakhstan instead of an official envoy. Iranian officials made clear they did not approve of the United States having a seat at the table. \u201cWe are against their presence,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said in January. President Hassan Rouhani also condemned the United States in veiled terms, speaking of \u201csome countries\u201d excluded from the talks as being \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201chelping the terrorists.\u201d\n\nAt the behest of Turkey, Syrian Kurdish militias who cooperate with the United States were also left out of the Astana talks.", "As Truth on the Market readers prepare to enjoy their Thanksgiving dinners, let me offer some (hopefully palatable) \u201cfood for thought\u201d on a competition policy for the new Trump Administration. In referring to competition policy, I refer not just to lawsuits directed against private anticompetitive conduct, but more broadly to efforts aimed at curbing government regulatory barriers that undermine the competitive process.\n\nPublic regulatory barriers are a huge problem. Their costs have been highlighted by prestigious international research bodies such as the OECD and World Bank, and considered by the International Competition Network\u2019s Advocacy Working Group. Government-imposed restrictions on competition benefit powerful incumbents and stymie entry by innovative new competitors. (One manifestation of this that is particularly harmful for American workers and denies job opportunities to millions of lower-income Americans is occupational licensing, whose increasing burdens are delineated in a substantial body of research \u2013 see, for example, a 2015 Obama Administration White House Report and a 2016 Heritage Foundation Commentary that explore the topic.) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Justice Department (DOJ) antitrust officials should consider emphasizing \u201cstate action\u201d lawsuits aimed at displacing entry barriers and other unwarranted competitive burdens imposed by self-interested state regulatory boards. When the legal prerequisites for such enforcement actions are not met, the FTC and the DOJ should ramp up their \u201ccompetition advocacy\u201d efforts, with the aim of convincing state regulators to avoid adopting new restraints on competition \u2013 and, where feasible, eliminating or curbing existing restraints.\n\nThe FTC and DOJ also should be authorized by the White House to pursue advocacy initiatives whose goal is to dismantle or lessen the burden of excessive federal regulations (such advocacy played a role in furthering federal regulatory reform during the Ford and Carter Administrations). To bolster those initiatives, the Trump Administration should consider establishing a high-level federal task force on procompetitive regulatory reform, in the spirit of previous reform initiatives. The task force would report to the president and include senior level representatives from all federal agencies with regulatory responsibilities. The task force could examine all major regulatory and statutory schemes overseen by Executive Branch and independent agencies, and develop a list of specific reforms designed to reduce federal regulatory impediments to robust competition. Those reforms could be implemented through specific regulatory changes or legislative proposals, as the case might require. The task force would have ample material to work with \u2013 for example, anticompetitive cartel-like output restrictions, such as those allowed under federal agricultural orders, are especially pernicious. In addition to specific cartel-like programs, scores of regulatory regimes administered by individual federal agencies impose huge costs and merit particular attention, as documented in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s annual \u201cRed Tape Rising\u201d reports that document the growing burden of federal regulation (see, for example, the 2016 edition of Red Tape Rising).\n\nWith respect to traditional antitrust enforcement, the Trump Administration should emphasize sound, empirically-based economic analysis in merger and non-merger enforcement. They should also adopt a \u201cdecision-theoretic\u201d approach to enforcement, to the greatest extent feasible. Specifically, in developing their enforcement priorities, in considering case selection criteria, and in assessing possible new (or amended) antitrust guidelines, DOJ and FTC antitrust enforcers should recall that antitrust is, like all administrative systems, inevitably subject to error costs. Accordingly, Trump Administration enforcers should be mindful of the outstanding insights provide by Judge (and Professor) Frank Easterbrook on the harm from false positives in enforcement (which are more easily corrected by market forces than false negatives), and by Justice (and Professor) Stephen Breyer on the value of bright line rules and safe harbors, supported by sound economic analysis. As to specifics, the DOJ and FTC should issue clear statements of policy on the great respect that should be accorded the exercise of intellectual property rights, to correct Obama antitrust enforcers\u2019 poor record on intellectual property protection (see, for example, here). The DOJ and the FTC should also accord greater respect to the efficiencies associated with unilateral conduct by firms possessing market power, and should consider reissuing an updated and revised version of the 2008 DOJ Report on Single Firm Conduct).\n\nWith regard to international competition policy, procedural issues should be accorded high priority. Full and fair consideration by enforcers of all relevant evidence (especially economic evidence) and the views of all concerned parties ensures that sound analysis is brought to bear in enforcement proceedings and, thus, that errors in antitrust enforcement are minimized. Regrettably, a lack of due process in foreign antitrust enforcement has become a matter of growing concern to the United States, as foreign competition agencies proliferate and increasingly bring actions against American companies. Thus, the Trump Administration should make due process problems in antitrust a major enforcement priority. White House-level support (ensuring the backing of other key Executive Branch departments engaged in foreign economic policy) for this priority may be essential, in order to strengthen the U.S. Government\u2019s hand in negotiations and consultations with foreign governments on process-related concerns.\n\nFinally, other international competition policy matters also merit close scrutiny by the new Administration. These include such issues as the inappropriate imposition of extraterritorial remedies on American companies by foreign competition agencies; the harmful impact of anticompetitive foreign regulations on American businesses; and inappropriate attacks on the legitimate exercise of intellectual property by American firms (in particular, American patent holders). As in the case of process-related concerns, White House attention and broad U.S. Government involvement in dealing with these problems may be essential.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now, folks. May you all enjoy your turkey and have a blessed Thanksgiving with friends and family.", "International trade restrictions already have generated substantial commentary and may loom large during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.[1] Accordingly, sound analysis of U.S. international trade regulation is particularly timely and important.\n\nPublic policies that rely on free-market forces and avoid government interventions that distort terms of international trade benefit producers, consumers, and national economies alike. \u201cAccording to data in the annual [Heritage Foundation] Index of Economic Freedom, countries with low trade barriers are more prosperous than those that restrict trade.\u201d[2] Specifically:\n\n[F]ree and open trade has fueled vibrant competition, innovation, and economies of scale, allowing individuals and businesses to take advantage of lower prices and increased choice. As a result, billions of people around the world have escaped the constraints of subsistence farming and extreme poverty that characterized the lives of most of humanity throughout history.[3]\n\nThe full benefits of international trade will not be realized, however, if sales and purchase decisions are distorted by anticompetitive behavior or other illegitimate commercial conduct (such as theft, fraud, or deceit) that undermines market forces. Transactions affected by such types of illicit business behavior do not reflect the efficient working of a free market. Thus, it is appropriate for governments to enact laws that seek to correct for such international trade distortions, and the United States has adopted a number of statutes with this end in mind.[4]\n\nThe provision of U.S. trade law that is targeted most specifically at anticompetitive and other harmful business conduct affecting American imports is Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.[5] Section 337 condemns as illegal imports that:\n\nViolate U.S. intellectual property (IP) rights related to a U.S. industry or\n\nInvolve \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair acts\u201d that cause harm to a U.S. industry.\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), an independent federal agency, is required to investigate allegations of Section 337 violations and direct the exclusion of the articles concerned when a violation is found, unless it deems that specified public policy conditions counsel against exclusion. The USITC may also issue \u201ccease and desist\u201d orders in lieu of exclusion orders. The President may disapprove (\u201cfor policy reasons\u201d) a Section 337 exclusion or cease-and-desist order within 60 days after he receives the proposed order from the USITC, but this has seldom been done.\n\nIn recent decades, almost all Section 337 cases have involved violations of U.S. IP rights, especially patents.[6] Overall, Section 337 does a good job of protecting the rights of American IP holders. In so doing, it discourages imports that \u201cfree ride\u201d on U.S. technology and thereby artificially distort the terms of competition in the affected American product markets. But the statute could be improved. Congressional consideration of possible targeted statutory reforms to address \u201cpolicy\u201d constraints on Section 337\u2019s application, potential limitations on its reach, and the breadth of the conduct it covers could make it an even more valuable tool with which to protect U.S. IP holders and combat truly unfair competition in a manner that is consistent with general free trade principles.\n\nIP Rights: Strengthening the American Economy and Protecting the Rights of Innovators\n\nBefore assessing Section 337\u2019s role in protecting federally protected IP rights, an understanding of the increasing importance of those rights to the American economy is essential.\n\nIP rights\u2014in particular, patents, copyrights, and trademarks\u2014are fundamental to economic growth. They encourage innovation by allowing inventors, authors, and other creative individuals to reap the rewards of their labor and by facilitating the commercialization of new technologies and products. Recognizing their importance, the Founding Fathers explicitly provided for the protection of IP rights under Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution (the IP Clause), which states:\n\nThe Congress shall have Power To\u2026promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\u2026.[7]\n\nOver the past 225 years, Congress has acted vigorously to protect the rights of IP holders. Under its authority found in the IP Clause and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Congress has enacted robust IP laws,[8] revising and extending them as necessary to deal with new technologies and novel forms of IP.[9] These efforts have paid huge dividends for America\u2019s economy, which has become increasingly IP-reliant, reflecting the technological advances that now pervade all segments of American industry.[10] A few statistics drawn from a 2012 U.S. Department of Commerce report and other recent scholarly research illustrate IP\u2019s importance to the American economy:\n\nIP-intensive industries added $5.06 trillion in value to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010;[11]\n\nIn 2010, 60.7 percent of U.S. merchandise exports stemmed from IP-intensive industries;[12]\n\nIn 2012, IP was estimated to have directly created 19 million jobs and supported 55 million jobs;[13]\n\nIP-spurred innovation has bolstered U.S. growth and employment by over 40 percent;[14]\n\nThe average worker in an IP-intensive industry earned about 30 percent more than his or her counterpart in a non-IP industry;[15] and\n\nAmerica\u2019s IP is worth $5.8 trillion, more than the nominal GDP of any other country in the world.[16]\n\nTo ensure the benefits of IP protection, federal law imposes steep penalties to deter IP infringers.[17] The general nature of federal IP sanctions is well illustrated by patent law.[18] Successful plaintiffs in patent litigation may be awarded lost profits, legal costs, and even treble damages.[19] Additionally, they may secure either preliminary or post-trial injunctions, federal court orders mandating that the defendant cease the challenged activity.[20] Because they directly block infringing activity, injunctions are a particularly powerful remedy for patentees. Federal court injunctive relief has become rare, however, as a result of an important 2006 Supreme Court decision.\n\nIn eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.,[21] the Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously that patent infringement does not automatically result in the issuance of an injunction. For a party to be granted injunctive relief, it must demonstrate that:\n\nThe injury will be irreparable,\n\nNo existing legal remedy exists to sufficiently compensate the plaintiff,\n\nIt has suffered more hardship than the respondent, and\n\nThe injunction would not trump the public interest.\n\nThese stringent requirements substantially lessen the ability of petitioners\u2014who at the same time must absorb enormous litigation cost burdens when they seek to defend their property rights in court\u2014to obtain injunctive relief.[22]\n\nWhile eBay sharply limited injunctive relief for patent holders involved in domestic cases, patentees can still obtain generous damages from domestic infringers in lieu of an injunction. U.S. patent holders are, however, virtually defenseless when protecting themselves against foreign parties. U.S. federal courts are empowered to adjudicate IP cases between parties holding assets within the United States, but they are often powerless to enforce IP rights when the infringer is located outside of U.S. jurisdiction.[23] Unless the foreign violator holds assets within the United States, the courts cannot deter foreign producers from breaking U.S. patent law. Thus, firms engaged in multinational disputes must litigate in multiple jurisdictions, which can lead to inconsistent outcomes and further swell court costs.[24] This is a serious problem for U.S. inventors.\n\nFurthermore, the United States is particularly ripe for patent infringement. It is the world\u2019s largest importer, and its people expect a high quality standard for consumer goods.[25] Thus, foreign producers seeking shares of the U.S. market are tempted to cheat and plagiarize profitable, patented American ideas.[26] Because foreign producers often cannot be held to account for infringement in U.S. courts (unless they have assets in the United States that can be used to pay a judgment), their infringements reduce the profits of victimized American IP holders, thereby discouraging future innovation and slowing economic growth.\n\nSection 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 offers a remedy for this problem, serving as a substitute for injunctive relief.\n\nSection 337: Providing Relief Not Available to the Courts\n\nResponding to a renewed demand for protectionism after World War I, Congress enacted Section 337 as part of the Tariff Act of 1930.[27] Section 337 has evolved substantially over the years.[28]\n\nAs originally written, the statute proved to be rather limited and ineffectual due to textual weaknesses (it did not provide a clear administrative mechanism for obtaining import relief) and institutional weaknesses (especially resource constraints and lack of expertise) that plagued the U.S. Tariff Commission, the agency that enforced the law.\n\nThe law was substantially rewritten and strengthened by the Trade Act of 1974. That Act transformed the Tariff Commission into the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), a revamped five-member independent agency that was given more resources for investigations and analysis as well as strengthened adjudicatory powers.\n\nFurther statutory amendments in 1988 made Section 337 an even more effective tool for combating unfairness in import trade and, in particular, violation of U.S. IP rights.\n\nA few additional statutory changes in 1994 were designed to ensure that Section 337 comported with the U.S.\u2019s obligations as a World Trade Organization member nation to afford \u201cnational treatment\u201d to imported articles (national treatment requires giving the same protections to imported goods as to nationally produced goods).[29]\n\nThe current version of the statute is broadly designed to protect American markets from unfair competition generated by foreign producers\u2019 practices (primarily IP infringements) that distort market forces. Unlike the court system, Section 337 litigation offers no ability to recoup monetary damages. It offers, however, two other strong remedies to protect the interest of IP holders.\n\nFirst, a USITC ruling in favor of the plaintiff generally leads to an exclusion order that disallows the foreign respondent from exporting the challenged good into the country.[30] These orders serve as de facto injunctions. For example, an exclusion order against a copycat patent-infringing medicine produced by a foreign pharmaceutical company would enable U.S. Customs to prevent the medicine from being imported into the United States. Moreover, when exclusion orders directed merely to particular respondents are insufficient to provide effective relief from infringement, the USITC may issue a \u201cgeneral\u201d exclusion order against all infringing imports from any source, including sources not named in the investigation, which may be useful when the source of infringing imports is not readily identifiable.\n\nOverall, these statutory provisions effectively allow U.S. producers to block the source of continuing harm due to infringing imports, not just to be compensated for continuing harm suffered. Relatedly, by making it much harder to obtain a court injunction, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in e-Bay led many more U.S. patent-holder victims of foreign patent infringement to seek Section 337 relief at the USITC rather than in federal court.\n\nSecond, a successful plaintiff in a Section 337 case may also be rewarded with issuance of a cease-and-desist order against the respondent.[31] If a respondent continues to import the infringing imports in violation of the order, it faces civil penalties of up to twice the amount of the value of the illicit imports. While this penalty is not as significant as an exclusion order, it nevertheless offers additional deterrence.\n\nIn addition, the ease, cost-efficiency, and speed of the USITC\u2019s quasi-judicial Section 337 process make it a particularly attractive forum for protecting patent rights. Contrary to federal district court procedure, all known violators of a patent right may be investigated under one umbrella Section 337 case. In addition, the USITC serves complaints to alleged violators directly by mail.[32]\n\nSection 337 complaints are now investigated and adjudicated in a more formalized court-like setting by USITC administrative law judges, many of whom possess patent expertise (a rarity among federal court judges). These complaints need not be translated, unlike in other proceedings.[33] After 10 days, if there has been no response to a complaint, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may issue a default judgment swiftly banning the challenged product from being imported.[34] When a trial does occur, the USITC rules \u201cat the earliest practicable time\u201d (normally within a year, with 18 months allowed for \u201cmore complicated\u201d inquiries,[35] although a few exceptional cases have taken more time).\n\nThese timetables are much faster and involve lower discovery costs than are involved in federal district court litigation. Hence, Section 337 litigation is effective and much less costly than traditional patent suits for American IP holders who are confronted by foreign infringers.\n\nIn recent years, Section 337 increasingly has been invoked by U.S. patent holders as a way to secure relief from infringing imports. In 2009, the USITC instituted 31 cases.[36] By 2011, the number of cases had grown to 69.[37] Absent some unexpected development, it may be expected that the number of Section 337 filings will to continue to grow as patents continue to be issued in large numbers, technologies are diffused broadly, and globalization leads to the siting of high-tech production facilities in more foreign locales.\n\nKey Elements of Section 337[38]\n\nSection 337 covers two types of violations.\n\nFirst, it declares unlawful \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair acts\u201d in the importation of \u201carticles\u201d into the United States (as well as sales after importation by the owner, importer, or consignee) that do not involve federally protected IP rights if such importation (1) threatens to destroy, substantially injure, or prevent the establishment of a U.S. industry or (2) threatens to restrain or monopolize U.S. trade or commerce. This first \u201cleg\u201d of the statute has given rise to very few Section 337 investigations in recent decades and does not merit much additional attention here.[39]\n\nSecond, Section 337 declares unlawful the importation of \u201carticles\u201d into the United States (as well as post-importation sales by the owner, importer, or consignee) that infringe the full panoply of federal statutory IP rights, including U.S. patents, copyrights, federally registered trademarks, federally registered designs, and federally registered semiconductor chip mask works. These IP-infringing imports violate Section 337, however, only if there exists a U.S. industry (or one is being established) related to the articles protected by U.S. IP rights. Such an industry exists if there is shown to be (1) \u201csignificant investment in plant or equipment,\u201d (2) \u201csignificant employment of labor or capital,\u201d or (3) \u201csubstantial investment in\u201d IP-related \u201cexploitation, including engineering, research and development, or licensing.\u201d\n\nThe third element reflects the increasing importance of IP licensing in the modern economy. Major American companies like Interdigital, Qualcomm, and Microsoft obtain enormous revenues from licensing their IP,[40] which in turn is an incentive for them to invest in future innovations and thereby spur the economy. Once the U.S. industry requirement is met, the infringement of federal statutory rights automatically establishes a Section 337 violation.\n\nThe USITC is required to investigate any alleged violation of Section 337 presented to it, or it may undertake such an investigation on its own initiative. Based on its investigation, the commission \u201cshall determine\u201d whether or not there is a violation of Section 337, except that it may terminate the investigation if all parties agree to the entry of a consent order or to the submission of the matter to binding arbitration. If the USITC determines there is a violation, \u201cit shall direct that the articles concerned\u2026be excluded from entry into the United States,\u201d and that order shall be enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department.[41]\n\nThere is, however, one important \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception to this directive: The USITC shall not issue an exclusion order if it finds that the articles in question should not be barred from entry \u201cafter considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers.\u201d In addition, the President has 60 days after he is notified of a Section 337 decision to disapprove it \u201cfor policy reasons\u201d and thereby automatically block its implementation, an authority that has been invoked only six times.[42]\n\nFinally, any person \u201cadversely affected\u201d by a final USITC decision\u2014including, most importantly, a decision to issue an exclusion order or a decision not to do so on \u201cpublic policy\u201d grounds[43]\u2014may appeal that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In reviewing such appeals, the Federal Circuit applies the Administrative Procedure Act,[44] which provides that federal agency decisions are to be struck down if they are \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d\n\nCurrent Section 337 Controversies\n\nThe application of Section 337 has generated substantial litigation and commentary in recent years.[45] Four Section 337 issues in particular merit highlighting, given their importance to the ability of the statute to provide relief to victims of IP infringement:\n\nThe statute\u2019s role vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cpatent assertion entities\u201d;\n\nIts application to non-tangible imports, such as data collections;\n\nIts application to items that do not directly infringe at the time of importation; and\n\nThe scope of the President\u2019s ability to overturn Section 337 exclusion orders on public policy grounds.\n\nIn addition, consideration of a statutory amendment precluding Section 337\u2019s application to non-IP-related unfair importation could help to ensure that the statute is applied consistently in a procompetitive, pro\u2013free trade manner.\n\nSection 337 and Patent Assertion Entities. Patent assertion entities (PAEs) are companies whose primary business model involves acquiring (or aggregating) patents developed by other parties and asserting the patents against companies that allegedly are employing the patented technology. PAEs make money either by obtaining licensing royalties up front or by suing parties for patent infringement and (typically) settling the suits for a specified sum of money.\n\nPAEs are also sometimes called \u201cpatent trolls\u201d because \u201crather than producing anything,\u201d they allegedly impose an inefficient tax on productive companies. Although some PAEs undoubtedly harm the economy by filing abusive lawsuits, many contribute to economic growth and efficiency:\n\nAlthough patent trolls undoubtedly have been responsible for individual wasteful lawsuits, the extent to which they actually have spawned a serious patent litigation problem is very much in question\u2026.\n\n[P]atent aggregators facilitate an efficient division of labor between inventors and those who wish to use those inventions for the betterment of their fellow man, allowing inventors to spend their time doing what they do best: inventing. Patent aggregators can expand access to patent pools that allow third parties to deal with one vendor instead of many, provide much-needed capital to inventors, and lead to a variety of licensing and sublicensing agreements that create and reflect a valuable and vibrant marketplace for patent holders and provide the kinds of incentives that spur innovation. They can also aggregate patents for litigation purposes, purchasing patents and licensing them in bundles\u2026.\n\nAll of this is to say that there can be good patent assertion entities that seek licensing agreements and file claims to enforce legitimate patents and bad patent assertion entities that purchase broad and vague patents and make absurd demands to extort license payments or settlements.[46]\n\nSome commentators have advocated precluding or limiting the Section 337 relief made available to PAEs. They have suggested such \u201creforms\u201d as new USITC rules that would restrict the scope of relief granted PAEs,[47] application of the eBay standard to greatly limit the granting of exclusion orders,[48] statutory amendments to eliminate or greatly narrow the application of Section 337 to PAEs,[49] and (most drastic of all) repeal of Section 337.[50]\n\nSuch proposals lack merit. They ignore the fact that eBay is designed for situations in which patent infringers can be reached and assessed damages in the absence of injunctions, a situation that typically does not apply to exporters, who operate outside the jurisdiction of the United States. The proposals also implicitly assume that denying PAEs Section 337 relief is an unalloyed good, ignoring the fact that many PAEs contribute substantially to economic growth and innovation. Denying economically beneficial PAEs vital protection from foreign infringers who cannot easily be reached may be expected to diminish the welfare-enhancing activities of those valuable patent intermediaries.\n\nTwo recent Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decisions have circumscribed Section 337\u2019s future application to PAEs seeking relief somewhat more modestly.\n\nIn 2011, in John Mezzalingua Associates v. International Trade Commission,[51] the Federal Circuit held that Section 337\u2019s application to a domestic industry that exists due to \u201csubstantial investments in\u2026licensing\u201d requires that the licensing in question not be solely for the sake of litigation, but rather must be part of a broader licensing effort.\n\nIn 2013, in InterDigital Communications v. International Trade Commission,[52] the Federal Circuit held that the licensing activity needed to satisfy the domestic industry requirement must have a tie to the specific asserted infringed patent.\n\nOverall, these Federal Circuit holdings appear to be reasonable. They allow economically productive, wealth-producing licensing operations to obtain Section 337 relief while denying protection to PAEs that likely are not being deterred from engaging in truly innovative activity. In short, even though they slightly limit the scope of Section 337\u2019s protective reach in the case of PAEs, these judicial decisions likely will not materially weaken property rights protections or undermine the American economy.\n\nSection 337 and Non-Tangible Imports. Section 337 applies to imported \u201carticles\u201d that infringe an IP right. In November 2015, in ClearCorrect Operating v. International Trade Commission,[53] the Federal Circuit held that electronic transmissions of digital data from abroad do not involve the importation of \u201carticles\u201d for purposes of Section 337, thereby stripping the USITC of jurisdiction over IP infringement facilitated through such transmissions.\n\nIf allowed to stand, this ill-reasoned decision will incentivize IP infringement schemes involving data imports, thereby harming U.S. IP holders. As the Motion Picture Association of America has noted, \u201c[t]his ruling, if it stands, would appear to reduce the authority of the [US]ITC to address the scourge of overseas web sites that engage in blatant piracy of movies, television programs, music, books, and other copyrighted works.\u201d[54] The continued rapid growth of Internet-enabled data transfers suggests that the cost of infringing data transmissions to U.S. industry may become quite substantial.\n\nAlign Technology, Inc., held various U.S. patents covering the production of orthodontic tooth-straightening appliances, known as aligners. ClearCorrect LLC (ClearCorrect US) used patented Align Technology without authorization to create digital models of patients\u2019 teeth and transmitted those models electronically to its Pakistani affiliate, ClearCorrect Pakistan. The Pakistani affiliate manipulated those models and then transmitted final digital models back to the United States, where ClearCorrect US utilized them to make orthodontic aligners.\n\nThe USITC found that ClearCorrect Pakistan engaged in infringing activity in Pakistan and that data transmission of its digital models to the United States violated Section 337. ClearCorrect appealed the USITC\u2019s determination to the Federal Circuit, and a three-judge panel ruled two-to-one that the term \u201carticles,\u201d which is not defined in the Tariff Act, refers to \u201cmaterial things,\u201d not to electronically transmitted digital data. In her dissent, Judge Pauline Newman argued unsuccessfully that the term \u201carticles\u201d was written broadly to be adaptable to new technologies, including data transmissions, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court itself has defined \u201carticles of commerce\u201d to include pure information.\n\nA simple statutory amendment clarifying that the term \u201carticles\u201d as used in Section 337 covers all intangible items (including, of course, information) as well as tangible items that may cross national boundaries would deal with the problem of infringing data transmissions and prevent the use of electronic means to evade Section 337\u2019s protective reach.\n\nSection 337 and Induced Infringement. In August 2015, in Suprema, Inc. v. ITC,[55] the Federal Circuit upheld the USITC\u2019s determination that under Section 337, goods that do not directly infringe a U.S. patent at the time they are imported nevertheless may be excluded from entry if they are used after importation to infringe directly at the inducement of the goods\u2019 seller.\n\nCross-Match Technologies owned four patents that involved certain fingerprint scanning devices. A Korean company, Suprema, Inc., made fingerprint scanners that an American company, Mentalix, Inc., bought and imported into the United States. Mentalix subsequently combined the scanners with Mentalix software and used and sold the scanners in the United States.\n\nThe USITC determined that Mentalix directly infringed a Cross-Match patent claim by integrating its software with the Suprema scanners. The USITC also found that Suprema was liable for inducing patent infringement by Mentalix in that it \u201cwillfully blinded\u201d itself to and \u201cactively encouraged\u201d Mentalix\u2019s infringing U.S. activities. In addition, Suprema \u201caided and abetted\u201d Mentalix\u2019s infringement by assisting Mentalix in getting Mentalix software to work with the scanners. Consequently, the USITC imposed a Section 337 exclusion order covering the importation of scanners used in the infringement.\n\nInitially, a three judge Federal Circuit panel found no Section 337 violation, reasoning that there are no \u201carticles that infringe\u201d at the time of importation when direct infringement does not occur until after importation. A majority of the full Federal Circuit, however, reversed. It determined (1) that Congress had not definitively answered the question whether the term \u201carticles that infringe\u201d could apply to the inducement of post-importation direct infringement and (2) that deference to the USITC\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language was appropriate, particularly given legislative history \u201cevidenc[ing] Congressional intent to vest the ITC with broad enforcement authority to remedy unfair trade acts.\u201d\n\nThe full Federal Circuit\u2019s Suprema majority decision has desirable economic implications because it forestalls schemes that would undermine IP rights by importing items that could be assembled into infringing products shortly after importation. Nevertheless, there is a strong argument, based on statutory interpretation, against the majority decision (supported by four dissenting Federal Circuit judges),[56] and the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this question.\n\nA narrow statutory amendment to Section 337 making it clear that the term \u201carticles that infringe\u201d applies to cases of post-importation induced infringement would eliminate any remaining legal uncertainty in this area and promote sound public policy.\n\nScope of the President\u2019s Disapproval Authority. As noted, Section 337 authorizes the President to disapprove Section 337 exclusion or cease-and-desist orders \u201cfor policy reasons.\u201d Unlike USITC public policy determinations, such presidential decisions are not reviewable by the courts, and they grant the President unlimited discretion[57] to deny relief to U.S. IP holders that the USITC has found are the victims of IP infringement or unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in import trade. Such a broad grant of discretion is inappropriate.\n\nIt appears justifiable to give the President some discretion to ensure the continuation of infringing imports to cope with national public health or safety emergencies (for example, temporary shortages of patented drugs needed to combat a looming epidemic or patented components needed for a critical weapons system in the face of a national security crisis). In such situations, time is of the essence, and grave national harm may result from the exclusion of key imports.\n\nNevertheless, apart from such limited emergency situations, it is highly problematic for the President unilaterally to overturn detailed, judicially reviewable, administrative fact-based findings invoked to implement a congressional policy that vindicates American IP rights. Notably, in other federal economic regulatory areas, the President cannot unilaterally overturn final judicially reviewable agency actions. Thus, for example, the President has no role to play in countermanding FTC orders that parties cease and desist from engaging in anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair actions[58] that are analogous to the sorts of bad practices in import trade (\u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair acts\u201d as well as infringements of U.S. IP rights) that Section 337 condemns.\n\nThere is good reason to preclude the President from unilaterally overturning agency actions of this sort. Allowing the President to intrude in an unpredictable fashion into an economically based law enforcement investigation carried out to implement congressional economic policy would inject undesirable uncertainty into business affairs and detract from neutral application of the law. Such uncertainty would be particularly harmful to U.S. IP holders who face substantial threats to their valuable property rights from foreign infringers.\n\nConcern about the President\u2019s inappropriate invocation of \u201cpolicy reasons\u201d unrelated to health or safety to overturn USITC determinations is not merely academic.[59] In August 2013, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), on behalf of the President,[60] disapproved a USITC decision to impose a limited exclusion order barring Apple from importing certain older model iPhones and iPads.[61] The limited exclusion order had been based on a USITC finding that Apple had infringed a certain U.S. patent owned by Samsung. Samsung had committed to license that patent and certain other key \u201cstandard essential\u201d patents (patents needed to implement a technical standard applicable to smartphones) on \u201cfair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory\u201d rates, but the USITC found that such a commitment did not preclude it from granting exclusion order relief, which it did, only to be overturned by the USTR.\n\nIn overturning the USITC\u2019s determination, the USTR did not acknowledge either the strong economic policy arguments in favor of injunction-like remedies[62] or the possibility that interjecting himself into what was in effect a commercial dispute over patent licensing terms could do more harm than good.[63] More generally, the significant possibility of error by the USTR in issuing \u201ceconomic policy\u201d rejections of detailed USITC Section 337 determinations, entirely free from the need to provide a substantial justification for doing so (given the lack of judicial review), is quite troublesome.\n\nIn order to forestall future questionable \u201cpublic policy\u201d disapprovals by the President, Congress might wish to consider amending Section 337 to provide that the President may overturn the issuance of USITC exclusion orders or cease-and-desist orders only on grounds of the public health or safety, including the national defense.\n\nSection 337 Violations Not Involving IP Infringement. As already discussed, Section 337 is well tailored to provide a relatively economical and focused forum for the vindication of IP rights, and its benefits in this context are apparent. It is not, however, well suited to be applied outside of the IP context to \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition\u201d and \u201cunfair acts.\u201d[64]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, immediately following the passage of the Trade Act of 1974, there was a flurry of non-IP-related investigations that proved to be highly contentious. These investigations provoked controversies about the scope and merits of Section 337\u2019s application, especially given the availability of other well-understood statutory remedies for anticompetitive and \u201cunfair\u201d acts,[65] including the antidumping statute (dealing with unfair pricing); the countervailing duty statute (dealing with unfair foreign government subsidies); the Federal Trade Commission Act (dealing with unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts); and the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts (dealing with the full panoply of anticompetitive acts).[66] Other federal agencies specifically raised concerns about Section 337\u2019s potential interference with other federal enforcement programs and with international trade relations.[67]\n\nReflecting on the problems engendered by Section 337\u2019s application to non-IP matters, three trade law experts concluded that:\n\nSection 337\u2026does not fill any substantial need for protection and redress of grievances unmet by other statutes, and it has substantial liability. It is at best ambiguous and, therefore, unpredictable on the important issues of jurisdiction over both subject matter and over parties; it is duplicative of relief available through other agencies and less effective in enforcing that relief; and its procedural limitations serve neither the public interest nor the demand for fairness in adjudication. No one\u2019s interest would suffer from the repeal of section 337.[68]\n\nAlthough Section 337 has not been applied to non-IP-related import practices in recent decades,[69] its statutory language covering such matters remains. If the USITC should decide to turn once again to investigations unrelated to IP, Section 337 conceivably could be applied in a manner that interfered with other federal statutes, as happened in the 1970s. Moreover, and perhaps even more seriously, Section 337 conceivably could be applied in a manner that is inimical to American economic welfare.\n\nSpecifically, the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice today apply antitrust and consumer protection law in a manner that is designed to promote a vibrant competitive process, economic efficiency, and the interests of American consumers.[70] But what if Section 337, which refers specifically to practices that \u201cinjure an industry in the United States,\u201d[71] were construed as reaching aggressive efficiency-enhancing actions by foreign companies that reduce costs and raise the quality of imports, thereby costing American firms sales but benefiting American consumers and the competitive process?[72] Such an application of Section 337 would be consistent with \u201cpublic choice\u201d theory, which demonstrates how well-organized producers (for example, inefficient American industries) may \u201ccapture\u201d a regulatory body and use it to reduce competition (for example, from efficient importers).[73]\n\nIt is likewise possible that the USITC might characterize as \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d foreign government reforms that reduced inefficiently high labor costs, environmental costs, or other regulatory burdens if those reforms were instigated or supported by foreign firms that exported to the United States.[74] Such a result would be most unfortunate, because a general lowering of inefficient cost burdens affecting internationally traded goods tends to raise economic well-being.[75]\n\nIn light of all of these considerations, Congress might also wish to consider rescinding the USITC\u2019s Section 337 authority with respect to non-IP-related import practices.\n\nConclusion\n\nSection 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 provides valuable relief to American IP holders whose property rights are undermined by infringing imports. In many cases, Section 337 may be the only truly effective means by which industries that depend on U.S. IP can protect their interests and compete on an undistorted playing field with imported products. Nevertheless, a few carefully tailored amendments to the statute could render it even more effective. Specifically, Congress should seriously consider language that would:\n\nClarify that Section 337 covers all imports, both intangible (such as electronic data compilations) and tangible;\n\nSpecify that it applies to import schemes aimed at infringing IP rights, even if there is no direct infringement at the precise time of importation;\n\nLimit the President\u2019s unreviewable discretion to overturn Section 337 exclusion orders, except on grounds of public health or safety; and\n\nEliminate Section 337\u2019s application to non-IP-related import practices.\n\nAdoption of reforms along these lines could make Section 337 an even more effective tool with which to protect U.S. IP rights in international trade and ensure that Section 337 is applied in a procompetitive, pro-consumer fashion. Such reforms would enhance the role of Section 337 as a law that supports American innovation and economic growth in a manner that is consistent with free trade principles.\n\nis Deputy Director of and John, Barbara, and Victoria Rumpel Senior Legal Fellow in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation.", "A bill proposing a constitutional amendment to establish an increased minimum wage was defeated in the Texas State House on Thursday. The measure failed by a vote of 92-50.\n\nThe bill, House Joint Resolution 26, was authored by Texas State House Representative Trey Martinez Fischer (D-San Antonio).\n\nIf passed by the Texas Legislature, it would have increased pay to either $10.10 an hour, or the federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act (currently $7.25 per hour for non-exempt employees), whichever was higher.\n\nCertain employees would remain exempt from the minimum wage, in accordance with existing law. The wage increase would not have applied to wages paid to patients and clients of certain state health services in compensation for assisting in facility operations or for occupational training. It would also not have applied to certain religious and nonprofit employers.\n\nThe Legislature could repeal or limit these exemptions, but could not expand them.\n\nThe fiscal note to the House Resolution from the Legislative Budget Board stated that the fiscal implications of an increased minimum wage had not been fully calculated, but the costs associated with such an increase could be quite significant.\n\nThe fiscal impact to state government would primarily be associated with employees who work for contracted entities.\n\nSeveral state agencies were surveyed about the impact of the legislation.\n\nAccording to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, there were 148,133 state agency employees as of January 2015. Employees who received hourly compensation of less than $10.10 per hour totaled 1,229. Paying these employees $10.10 per hour would cost about $1.6 million per fiscal year, including increased state contributions to the Employee Retirement System.\n\nThe cost to higher education agencies was estimated at $2.2 million.\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) currently pays maintenance workers the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Raising the minimum rate to $10.10 would have cost $108 million in fiscal year 2016, assuming the effective date of the legislation was September 1, 2015.\n\nThe Legislative Budget Board reported that costs associated with the joint resolution, assuming current contracts and practices remained the same, could range from $595 million to $655 million in General Revenue Funds through the biennium ending August 31, 2017.\n\nThe cost to local governmental entities would have depended on the current minimum wage of the local government, and the number of employees currently earning a wage below the greater of the federal minimum wage or the new Texas minimum of $10.10 per hour.\n\nProponents contend that a minimum wage increase would benefit the economy, and the quality of life for Texas workers.\n\nOpponents warn that increasing the minimum wage would result in the loss of jobs and opportunities because businesses would be forced to fire employees, offer fewer hours, or cut benefits.\n\nThe proposal would have been presented to voters in the November 3rd election this year.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Hailstorms are the latest weather catastrophe to be abused by these bad actors.\n\nA consumer protection bill authored by Senator Taylor is designed to eliminate catastrophic weather lawsuit abuse, while ensuring homeowners receive claims payments from insurers that are both fair and timely. The co-author of the bill is Sen. Van Taylor (R-Plano).\n\nProponents say weather-related events mean big business, and Texas has more weather-related events than any other state. They estimate hail-related damages have cost Texas $10.5 billion between 2004 and 2013.\n\nForty-two counties currently have hail damage litigation. Three hundred lawsuits were filed in 25 Texas counties just during the week of April 15th-23rd of this year. Real damages totaling only a few thousand dollars are producing demands of $100,000 or more.\n\nThose who are up-in-arms over hailstorm litigation say plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have raked in over $800 million in attorney\u2019s fees from property damage lawsuits in recent years.\n\nThese bad actors caused a surge in lawsuits after hailstorms hit Hidalgo County in 2012. They have used television and radio, direct mail, and door-to-door solicitation to promote their agenda.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are inflating actual damages, and applying mass tort litigation models to simple property damage claims. Insurance carriers say that in many cases, they have not even received a claim or communication from a policyholder prior to being served with a lawsuit.\n\nSupporters of Senate Bill 1628 say 30% of hail and windstorm claims have become lawsuits, and at least 80% of these lawsuits were filed after the initial claim was paid. On the other hand, only a small number of consumer complaints have been filed. For example, just 24 consumer complaints from Hidalgo County were reportedly filed with the Texas Department of Insurance through 2014.\n\nTaylor\u2019s reform legislation is supported by the following groups and companies: Texas Association of Business, Texans for Lawsuit Reform, Texas Chemical Council, Energy, American Insurance Association, Texas Bankers Association, Texas Association of Manufacturers, Association of Electric Companies of Texas, Inc., Texas Farm Bureau Insurance, and other insurance groups.\n\nSenate Bill 1628 allows homeowners to collect 18% penalty interest, pre-judgment interest, and attorney\u2019s fees if the insurer \u201cknowingly\u201d violated the law.\n\nThe bill requires notice of the claim before filing a lawsuit, with the amount of the claim and attorney\u2019s fees specified. It also requires that the claimant indicate the total amount the policyholder will accept in settlement of the claim. The idea is to allow insurers a reasonable opportunity to settle legitimate claims after review.\n\nThe proposed law also requires a claim to be filed within two years of a property-damage event. Proponents of the bill say this is fair because property owners should know whether their property has suffered damage by the end of the two-year period.\n\nThe legislation clarifies that laws governing insurance fraud also cover contractors, estimators, and adjusters. Those covered by the law may not agree to waive, absorb, rebate, subsidize, or credit an insurance deductible, or provide an estimate for repairs that is inflated to exceed the deductible.\n\nS.B. 1628 increases oversight of public insurance adjusters, including regulations preventing them from accepting fees unless they actually provide services, or soliciting clients for lawyers.\n\nOther measures in the bill address problems caused by lawyers who sue Texas-based independent adjusters in order to forum-shop for a judge and increase litigation costs.\n\nBreitbart Texas spoke with Joe Roseland from Mission, Texas, whose agency had over 2,000 property policies with Hochheim Prairie Farm Mutual Insurance Company. He said many of these policies involved older homes valued at under $100,000.\n\nHochheim Insurance served the underserved, with annual premiums for these dwellings ranging from $400 to $700.\n\nRoseland said that since Hochheim has withdrawn from the market in Hidalgo County, premiums for lower-value dwellings have more than doubled. Many homeowners are now unable to afford the increased premiums, and are uninsured as a result.\n\nHe added that Germania Insurance Company has also pulled out of Hidalgo County. Roseland said the poorest residents have been hit hardest by the loss of affordable options from these providers.\n\nRoseland told Breitbart Texas that after the devastating hailstorms of March 29th and April 20th of 2012, insurance companies were besieged with claims. He said that right before the two-year deadline in 2014, public adjusters were hanging flyers door-to-door, soliciting at supermarkets and flea markets, and even standing on street corners with signs soliciting claimants for \u201chail damage\u201d litigation.\n\nThe flurry of activity in the last four months before the filing deadline produced over 4,000 additional lawsuits.\n\nRoseland gave examples of how attorney involvement impacted claim settlements. One of his examples was from central Mission, Texas, which was on the western edge of the hailstorm. This area experienced a minimal amount of hail. The adjuster\u2019s estimate of damage in the case cited by Roseland was approximately $7,000. The claim was paid by Hochheim, but the insured nevertheless hired a trial lawyer, and the claim was eventually settled in 2014 for an additional $194,000. He said repairs have yet to be made on this home.\n\nRoseland said current law dictates the procedures insurance companies must follow, with no margin of error for adjusters and insurance companies in the claim settlement process. This opens the door for public adjusters, unethical contractors, and trial lawyers to \u201cshake down\u201d insurance companies for settlements totaling ten times the actual damages.\n\nTexas Watch is a group that bills itself as a consumer protection, citizen advocacy, and corporate accountability group. Senator Larry Taylor, author of S.B. 1628, has accused it of being a \u201ctrial lawyer front group.\u201d\n\nThe conservative senator says Texas Watch and other groups acting on behalf of trial lawyers are \u201cconsistently distort[ing] the truth.\u201d In a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas, Taylor said these groups falsely characterize his bill as \u201cstripping\u201d policy holders of their right to timely payments, or even the right to collect any of their homeowner insurance benefits.\n\n\u201cTexas Watch has long tried to deceive the public by portraying themselves as a pro-consumer group, but according to their filing with the Texas Secretary of State, the seven-member board of Texas Watch is dominated by personal injury trial lawyers and their allies, including the longtime spokesman for the Texas Trial Lawyers Association (TTLA) Willie Chapman, and Dallas trial lawyer D. Shawn Stevens,\u201d said Senator Taylor. \u201cThe Deputy Director of Texas Watch, Ware Wendall, is a personal injury trial lawyer. Distorting the intent of this bill and creating fear in policyholders protects trial lawyers\u2019 businesses and wallets.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 1628 has been passed in the Senate and is now in the Insurance Committee of the Texas State House.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Follow her on Twitter @LanaShadwick2", "A longtime statutory probate judge in Harris County, Texas, is raising an issue which begs the question of where the legislature\u2019s power over the judiciary begins and ends. It is his opinion, that Senate Bill 1876, relating to appointing attorneys, mediators, or guardians, via a rotating list, is unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers.\n\nThe separation of powers doctrine prohibits one branch of government from exercising a power belonging inherently to another.\n\nTexas courts have consistently held that the separation of powers doctrine is violated \u201cwhen the functioning of the judicial process in a field constitutionally committed to the control of the courts is interfered with by the executive or legislative branches.\u201d\n\nThe senate bill is set on the general state calendar in the Texas State House for Monday, May 25th. The House will convene on Memorial Day, and has worked the holiday weekend, in order to get their work done at the end of the 84th Legislative session.\n\nThe seventeen-year jurist, probate court judge Rory Olsen, has told Texas lawmakers that the bill, which was passed in the Senate on May 4th, and heard in the House Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence committee on May 19th, is an unconstitutional overreach by the legislature upon the judiciary.\n\nJudge Olsen testified before the House Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence committee when the committee held a hearing and took testimony.\n\nS.B. 1876 is authored by Democrat Senator Judith Zaffirini (D-Laredo). She represents the 21st Senatorial District which stretches from the Rio Grande to the Colorado River and to the Port of Corpus Christi and the Valley. Sen. Zaffirini is the second longest serving legislator in the Texas Senate.\n\nJudge Olsen told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe Texas constitution is unique because it contains a very explicit separation of powers provision which dates back to the Republic of Texas. I am of the opinion that SB 1876 violates the doctrine of the separation of powers because it attempts to micromanage the court system in a way far beyond the lawful powers of the legislature.\u201d\n\nThe judge continued, \u201cThis issue needs to be addressed now before things get any further out of hand.\u201d\n\nThe 65-year-old judge earned his Juris Doctor from Duke University, his master of laws in taxation (L.L.M.) from Southern Methodist University, and his master of judicial studies (M.J.S.) from the National Judicial College.\n\nThe bill provides that every court in the state of Texas shall establish and maintain a list of all attorneys who are qualified to serve as an attorney ad litem, guardian ad litem, mediator, or guardian. Each court must then use a rotation system and appoint the attorney whose name appears next on the list. If the lawyer is appointed, the court then must place that attorney\u2019s name at the end of the list.\n\nArticle II, section 1 of the Texas Constitution provides:\n\nThe powers of the Government of the State of Texas shall be divided into three distinct departments, each of which shall be confided to a separate body of magistracy, to wit: Those which are legislative to one; those which are executive to another, and those which are judicial to another; and no person, or collection of persons, being of one of these departments, shall exercise any power properly attached to either of the others, except in the instances herein expressly permitted.\n\nJudge Olsen states that S.B. 1876 is attempting to micromanage how courts make appointments. The power to appoint people to assist a court in the performance of its duties is a power properly attached to the judiciary and no other branch of government.\n\nSoon after the Speedy Trial Act became effective, Judge Sam Houston Clinton, Jr. of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals prophesied in an opinion that the Speedy Trial Act was \u201c\u2018subject to an attack that its effects violate the separation of powers provision of Article II of the Constitution of the State of Texas.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his earlier opinion in a case (Ordunez v. Bean), Judge Clinton opined that the Texas Speedy Trial Act deprives prosecuting attorneys of their right to exercise judgment and discretion in performing their exclusive prosecutorial functions.\n\nHe was also of the opinion that it entrenched upon the power and authority of state trial courts to manage their affairs, including controlling their own dockets.\n\nAnd true to Judge Clinton\u2019s prediction, the highest criminal court in Texas later found the Texas Speedy Trial Act unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine.\n\nJudge Olsen has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law School and the National Judicial College.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas. Follow her on Twitter @LanaShadwick2.", "Pro-life legislation making it more difficult for Texas judges to bypass parental notification when their children are seeking an abortion is gaining speed in the Lone Star State. The bill is sponsored by Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) and strengthens judicial bypass laws. After four hours of debate on the Texas Senate floor on Memorial Day, it received preliminary approval by a 20-11 vote margin. The bill now goes to a third reading as amended on Tuesday, May 26th.\n\nThe intent of the bill, in cases involving pregnant minors seeking a judicial bypass, is to protect the pregnant minor while also protecting parental rights.\n\nJudicial bypass procedures are the legal process by which pregnant minors can seek court approval for an abortion, in cases where asking their parents for permission could endanger them.\n\nThe law also stipulates procedures to be followed during these court proceedings.\n\nH.B. 3994 tightens the procedures that minors must complete, and is the first major pro-life legislation to pass in this legislative session.\n\nOne of those restrictions involves the location where minors may seek a judicial bypass. Under current law, the application can be filed in any county in the state. H.B. 3994 would require minors to seek a judicial bypass in the county where they live. An exception is made for counties with population under 10,000. In those cases, minors can file their application in a neighboring county, or in the county where the abortion procedure will be performed.\n\nIn addition, the burden of proof for obtaining an abortion has been raised. If the bill is signed into law, the minor will have to offer proof under the standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to overcome the legal presumption that notifying and requesting consent from a parent is in the minor\u2019s best interest. The standard under current law is a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d\n\nMoreover, as reported by Breitbart Texas, rulings by judges in judicial bypass cases would no longer be kept from the public. The rulings would be included in a report by the Texas Office of Court Administration, which is made public annually. The name of the minor involved would be kept anonymous. Until now, the names of the judges and the details of their rulings have been kept confidential, along with the names of the minors.\n\nThe pregnant minor would also have to appear before the court in person, and would be prohibited from appearing using videoconferencing, telephone conferencing, or other remote electronic means.\n\nThe Senate vote on Memorial Day ran largely along partisan lines, with one Democrat joining Republicans. Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. a Democrat from Brownsville, frequently votes with Republicans on abortion legislation.\n\nA controversial version of the House Bill which would have required physicians to presume that a pregnant woman was a minor, unless she showed a government issued ID to prove she was 18 years or older, was removed before the bill was considered on the Senate floor.\n\nAn amendment to the bill requires doctors to use \u201cdue diligence\u201d to determine a woman\u2019s age and identity, but allows the doctor to proceed with an abortion if the woman does not have an ID. Physicians will be required to file a report annually indicating how many abortions they performed without \u201cproof of identity and age.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that the judicial bypass process is used as intended, not frivolously but as a tool to protect minor victims from abuse,\u201d said Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock), in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cHB 3994 strengthens parental rights, protects minors, and reduces unlawful abortions.\u201d\n\nThe bill has the combined support of Texas Right to Life, Texas Alliance for Life, Texas Catholic Conference, and the Texans for Life Coalition.\n\n\u201cI am proud that the final legislation is supported by all the major pro-life groups in Texas,\u201d continued Perry. \u201cThis bill could not have passed without the unified efforts of the various stakeholders, my fellow legislators, and the leadership of Lt. Governor Dan Patrick and House Author Rep. Geanie Morrison.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled that the Senate has given preliminary approval to this bill to reform the judicial bypass,\u201d said Joe Pojman, President of Texas Alliance for Life. \u201cThis bill restores the right of parents to protect their minor daughters from abortion. We commend Sen. Perry for his strong defense of this wonderful bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe final version of the bill encompasses many needed reforms to the judicial process available to minors seeking an abortion without involvement from their parents,\u201d said Emily Kebodeaux of Texas Right to Life. \u201cWe appreciate the leadership that both Senator Perry and Representative Morrison have shown by getting this crucial legislation a vote in the final days of the session.\u201d\n\nThe senate will most likely get to the measure on third reading on Tuesday, May 25th.\n\nIf signed by Governor Greg Abbott, H.B. 3994 will become law on September 1, 2015.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The federal government should act quickly to restore the vitality of our patent system and thereby strengthen the American economy.\n\nPatent protection is authorized in the Constitution to \u201cpromote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts,\u201d and American patent laws have been on the books since 1790, when Congress passed the first Patent Act.\n\nA patent is a time-limited property right granted to inventors under U.S. law for a novel, useful, and non-obvious invention. A patent confers \u201cthe right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling\u201d the invention in the United States or \u201cimporting\u201d the invention into the United States.\n\nThe Patent and Trademark Office, an agency within the Commerce Department, reviews patent applications and issues patents for inventions that meet patentability criteria.\n\nPatents played a central role in supporting the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century America, and they were associated with key U.S. innovative breakthroughs in the 20th and early 21st century as well.\n\nPatent-enabled breakthroughs led to new products that fundamentally transformed American industry\u2014sewing machines in the 1800s; telephones, airplanes, antibiotics, and electrical equipment in the 1900s; smartphones and new biologic drugs in the 2000s, just to name a few.\n\nIn short, patents have clearly been at the heart of successive waves of critically important American commercial innovation and continue to make enormous contributions to the American economy.\n\nBut today, unfortunately, U.S. patent rights are under serious threat.\n\nFor starters, a series of Supreme Court decisions over the last 15 years have made it harder to obtain and defend a patent.\n\nFor example, in its 2006 eBay v. MercExchange decision, the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a patent holder to obtain a federal court injunction\u2014an order preventing others from using patented technology without permission.\n\nAnd more recently, the Supreme Court has cut back significantly on what it deems \u201cpatent eligible,\u201d particularly in such areas as biotechnology, computer-implemented inventions, and software.\n\nAs Gene Quinn, a leading patent lawyer, explains, these changes mean that today \u201cthere are many other parts of the world that have more expansive views of what can be patented, including Europe, Australia, and even China.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, the America Invents Act of 2011 established a Patent Trial and Appeals Board within the Patent and Trademark Office to review already-issued patents at the request of third parties.\n\nPatent experts note that this Board has wreaked havoc, striking down the vast majority of patent claims it considers in a way that undermines fundamental due process rights of patent holders.\n\nBy eliminating numerous statutorily protected patents, the Board review makes patents less valuable. Investors will be less willing to invest in new patents covering groundbreaking inventions if there is a good chance that copycats seeking a \u201cfree ride\u201d on these innovations can get the Board to kill the patent rights.\n\nIn June 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case of Oil States Energy Services v. Greene\u2019s Energy Group, which will decide whether the Board\u2019s reviews violate the Constitution by allowing patent rights to be extinguished without the possibility of a jury trial.\n\nBut given the Supreme Court\u2019s faulty track record, it is far from clear that the high court will overturn the system.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Until the past few years, American antitrust policy respected the rights of inventors to receive full and fair returns on their patent rights. But that policy changed during the Obama administration, as antitrust enforcers focused on limiting patent-licensing fees on patents that are important in high-tech industries that rely on technical standards.\n\nSimilarly, foreign antitrust agencies have chimed in, bringing their own enforcement actions against patent holders.\n\nMore broadly, the Obama administration\u2019s regulatory posture on patent-antitrust policy created an environment that is less favorable to patents.. These actions have undermined the incentives of patent owners to develop new technologies\u2014and, in particular, to invest in technologies related to standards, to the detriment of innovation.\n\nThe harmful consequences of these \u201canti-patent\u201d developments are becoming apparent. A 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranking of national patent systems found that the United States has slipped to No. 10 in the world in strength of patent protection (tied with Hungary), after having been rated No. 1 in prior rankings.\n\nThis is bad because economic research \u201cdemonstrates that strong patent systems, which encourage research and development and investment, spur innovation and support robust economic growth.\u201d\n\nIn short, American innovation and economic growth will suffer if something is not done. Fortunately, there are public policy cures for the anti-patent disease. Specifically (as I have explained previously in greater detail):\n\nFederal legislation should eliminate (ideally) or at the very least strongly rein in the Patent Trial and Appeals Board.\n\nCongress should also change substantive patent law to overturn Supreme Court decisions that have harmfully limited patent eligibility and remedies for patent owners.\n\nPresident Donald Trump should take actions to appoint \u201cpro-patent\u201d officials and establish strong \u201cpro-patent\u201d policies throughout his administration.\n\nU.S. antitrust officials should reverse the Obama administration\u2019s misguided anti-patent policies.\n\nThe Trump administration should vigorously oppose foreign actions aimed at undermining American patent rights. It should also act on the global stage to promote greater respect and protection for patents.\n\nWhile not a panacea, taken together, these proposals provide a blueprint for making America once again the world\u2019s leader in patent protection\u2014and for enhancing American innovation and economic growth.", "The Constitution unequivocally grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds for the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d operations of government.[1] James Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 58 that providing budgetary powers to Congress was a critical element in maintaining individual rights: \u201cThe power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\u201d[2]\n\nCongress\u2019s power of the purse resides in its power to make laws. However, the Constitution does not distinguish between laws that provide funding and those that authorize programs. The ambiguity derived from the Constitution has resulted in rules established by the House and Senate, and reinforced through budget laws, distinguishing bills that appropriate funds annually and those that authorize programs.[3] According to the Government Accountability Office\u2019s (GAO) Principles of Appropriations Law (known as the Red Book), an appropriation provides an agency with the \u201cdirection to pay and a designation of funds to be used\u201d to implement a program.[4] At the same time, a law providing an authorization gives the agency the directive to carry out a program, but not necessarily the funds needed for its implementation.\n\nThere are rules in the House and Senate that place restrictions on the annual appropriations bills funding discretionary agencies and programs, which are enforced through points of order. These rules are typically ignored. For instance, the House has had a rule in place since 1837 prohibiting any appropriation for an unauthorized program,[5] and yet, the fiscal year (FY) 2016 House Commerce, Science, and Justice bill funded 91 programs with expired authorizations.[6] At the same time, \u201climitation riders\u201d prohibiting or directing the use of funds for certain purposes are allowed under congressional rules and have been a part of all appropriations bills since the 1870s.[7]\n\nCongress should use policy riders to advance important policy objectives.[8] This Backgrounder recommends legislative and limitations policy riders that should be included in the regular appropriations bills for the remainder of FY 2016. The recommendations are categorized by appropriations subcommittee.\n\nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\nCongress should:\n\nProhibit Funding for the USDA Catfish Inspection Program. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for inspecting both domestic and imported seafood. However, in the 2008 farm bill, a special exception was created that requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to inspect catfish. The program (still to be implemented), which the USDA has estimated will cost about $14 million annually,[9] will impose costly duplication because facilities that process seafood including catfish will be required to comply with both FDA and USDA regulations.\n\nThis widely opposed program will hurt consumers by limiting competition, and will likely harm industries by provoking retaliatory trade measures by foreign countries. Catfish inspection, like other seafood inspection, should remain with the FDA.[10]\n\nWithhold Funding for Federal Fruit and Vegetable Supply Restrictions. In June 2015, the United States Supreme Court decided Horne v. Department of Agriculture,[11] a case regarding the federal government\u2019s authority to fine raisin growers who did not hand over part of their crop to the government. The Court held that forcing growers to turn over their raisins was a taking of private property requiring just compensation.\n\nWhile the \u201craisin case\u201d received much attention because of the outrageous nature of the government\u2019s actions, it is far from unique. In particular, the USDA uses its power to enforce a number of cartels through industry agreements known as marketing orders. Fruit and vegetable marketing orders[12] allow the federal government to authorize supply restrictions (volume controls) limiting the amounts that agricultural producers may sell. Marketing orders are bad enough, but, at a minimum, Congress should stop funding these volume controls that limit how much of their own fruits and vegetables private farmers may sell.[13]\n\nProhibit Funding for National School Lunch Program Standards. The USDA\u2019s new school lunch standards implementing the Healthy and Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 have been a failure. These standards are a burden on schools and have resulted in many negative outcomes. For example, a January 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) shows that since the implementation of the new standards, participation in the school lunch program has declined, there has been an increase in food waste among students, and some schools have dropped out of the program at least partially due to the new standards.[14] The new standards have also imposed greater costs on schools, such that some have even have had to draw from their education funds to cover the new costs.[15] No funding should be directed toward implementation and enforcement of these standards.\n\nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\nCongress should:\n\nRestrict funding to the U.S. Census Bureau for the annual supplemental poverty measure (SPM) report. The SPM is a relative poverty measure; rather than determining whether a household is poor based on its income, as the official U.S. poverty measure does, the SPM determines a household\u2019s poverty status by comparing its income to the income of other households. The SPM undergirds a \u201cspread-the-wealth\u201d agenda, and it should be eliminated.[16]\n\nDefense\n\nCongress should:\n\nPut a High Priority on Missile Defense. Iran\u2019s ballistic missile force, the largest in the Middle East, poses a growing threat to its neighbors. Washington should help Israel to strengthen its missile defenses and help the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to build an integrated and layered missile defense architecture to blunt the Iranian missile threat. The U.S. Navy should be prepared to deploy warships equipped with Aegis ballistic missile defense systems to appropriate locations to help defend Israel and the GCC allies from Iranian missile attacks as circumstances demand. This will require coordinating missile defense activities among the various U.S. and allied missile defense systems through a joint communications system. The U.S. should also field missile defense interceptors in space for intercepting Iranian missiles in the boost phase, which would add a valuable additional layer to missile defenses.\n\nEnd Renewable Energy Mandates in the Department of Defense. Such mandates undermine the incentive for producers of renewable energy to develop competitively priced products, thereby actually impeding marketplace diversity. In particular, under Section 2911(e) of Title 10 of the United States Code, the Defense Department is obligated to generate 25 percent of its electricity using renewable sources by 2025. This mandate, which is forcing the Pentagon to expend increasing resources on renewable energy rather than on military capability, should be ended immediately.[17]\n\nEnergy and Water Development, and Related Agencies\n\nCongress should:\n\nMaintain Funding for Yucca Mountain Nuclear Materials Repository Licensing Review. Deep geologic storage is necessary for any long-term nuclear waste management solution. Despite the Obama Administration\u2019s refusal to support the program, the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, legally mandates the Department of Energy (DOE) to carry forth a licensing process for just such a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. There are more than sufficient resources[18] set aside in the nuclear waste fund for precisely that purpose. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) anticipates that the process will cost another $330 million, an amount the President\u2019s budget did not request.[19]\n\nCongress should provide $50 million to the NRC for the next fiscal year and stipulate, as the FY 2016 House Energy and Water Appropriations bill did, that no funds may be spent on any alternative nuclear waste management plan, most notably the President\u2019s shortsighted \u201cStrategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste,\u201d unless and until Congress passes legislation specifying otherwise. Further, a continuing resolution should clarify that no funds may be used for \u201cactions that irrevocably remove the possibility that Yucca Mountain may be a repository option in the future.\u201d[20] Congress must not be complicit in the Obama Administration\u2019s refusal to follow the law and should therefore fund the Yucca Mountain repository licensing review.[21]\n\nFinancial Services and General Government\n\nCongress should:\n\nProhibit Funding for the Export\u2013Import Bank. The charter of the Export\u2013Import Bank (Ex\u2013Im) was reauthorized by Congress on December 3, 2015. The bank provides discount financing to foreign firms and foreign governments for the purchase of American exports. The program primarily benefits multinational corporations and puts unsubsidized U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage, and taxpayers at financial risk. Ex\u2013Im provides taxpayer-backed financing for just 2 percent of U.S. exports. Subsidies for air transport comprise the vast majority of Ex\u2013Im financing\u2014primarily benefitting Boeing.\n\nEx\u2013Im was capitalized with $1 billion in taxpayer dollars, and its financing is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, which means that taxpayers are on the hook for any losses that the bank fails to cover with reserves. There is no shortage of private financing available.[22]\n\nEliminate the Funding for the Multi-State Plan Program. Under Section 1334 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Congress created the Multi-State Plan Program (MSP) to be administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM was to contract with at least two insurance companies to compete eventually with all other private health plans in the health insurance exchanges in every state.[23]\n\nIn 2014, OPM contracted with only one large insurer, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. In 2015, OPM added the so-called co-op plans to its roster of plans, even though these plans were financially unstable and about half have since collapsed. The MSP is not expanding market competition. In fact, the program sets standards designed to limit plan entry, and may decrease competition and further increase consolidation in the health insurance market.[24]\n\nMoreover, some multi-state plans can provide coverage of elective abortion, while remaining eligible for government subsidies. This is a significant departure from the widely accepted and long-standing policy that taxpayer money should not pay for coverage of elective abortions.[25]\n\nThe MSP, like the co-op program, was a substitute for the \u201crobust\u201d public option, a government health plan to compete with private insurance, a key feature of the original version of health reform legislation championed by the Obama Administration. There is no need for the federal government to be sponsoring special health plans to compete against private health plans; the markets are already less competitive than they were before enactment of the law, and government-sponsored plans threaten to further accelerate that consolidation.\n\nProtect Freedom of Conscience in the District of Columbia. Congress should prohibit the District of Columbia from using any federal or local funding to implement or enforce the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act or Human Rights Amendment Act.\n\nIn 2014, the District of Columbia passed two bills, one that discriminates against pro-life groups, and the other that violates the religious liberty of religious schools in the District. The Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act could require pro-life organizations to hire individuals who advocate for abortion. The Human Rights Amendment Act could force Christian schools to violate their beliefs about human sexuality and recognize LGBT student groups or host \u201cgay pride\u201d days on campus.[26]\n\nHomeland Security\n\nCongress should:\n\nEnsure an effective vetting process for Syrian refugees to enter the U.S. There are serious concerns with the President\u2019s proposal to accept additional Syrian refugees without assurances that adequate vetting is occurring. Congress must assert its authority and ensure an effective vetting process, such as requiring a risk based-assessment drawn from the considered judgment of the U.S. intelligence community for Congress to understand the risks entailed in accepting additional refugees. Congress also should require the Administration to develop a plan that documents proper screening and vetting for all the individuals being considered for resettlement in the United States. In addition, Congress must ensure that the Administration fully follows the law as established, with no deviations from or executive overreach outside existing statute, and fully consult with Congress on the development of the plan, its substance, and the execution of the operation.\n\nInterior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\nCongress should:\n\nRein in the EPA\u2019s Ozone Standard. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new ozone standard of 70 parts per billion (ppb) in October 2015. This drastic action is premature. States are just now starting to meet the current 75 ppb standard. According to the Congressional Research Service, 123 million people live in areas that have not attained the current standards. In fact, 105 million people live in areas that are still considered nonattainment for the less-stringent 1997 ozone standard. When nearly 40 percent of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that have not met the current standard, adopting an even more stringent standard is, at best, premature.[27]\n\nOpen Access to Natural Resource Development. Congress should open all federal waters and all non-wilderness, non-federal-monument lands to exploration and production of all of America\u2019s natural resources. Congress should require the Department of the Interior both to conduct lease sales if a commercial interest exists (whether for offshore oil or for offshore wind), and to use its flexibility under its current authority (whether streamlining of red tape or lower royalties) to attract interest to federal lands.[28]\n\nProhibit a Net Increase in Federal Lands. The federal estate is massive, consisting of some 635 million acres. The effective footprint is even larger because limitations on federal lands often affect the use of adjacent state and private lands, since government agencies lock up lands through informal designations and study areas. Regulatory pushes threaten to put almost all of the United States under some form of federal jurisdiction. Federal ownership and federal regulation of public lands restrict economic activity, and, in many instances, have created environmental problems due to mismanaged lands and lack of a proper incentive structure to maintain the properties.[29]\n\nAllow the Land and Water Conservation Fund to Expire Permanently. The federal government owns some 635 million acres of land throughout the United States\u2014that is nearly 30 percent of the entire country, and nearly half of the western U.S. This massive amount of federal ownership has resulted in land mismanagement, stifled opportunities for recreation and resource production, and poor environmental management. Rather than placing more decisions under Washington\u2019s control, Congress should empower the states and local communities to protect their environments, maximize the value of the land, and create new opportunities for economic development.[30]\n\nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\nCongress should:\n\nRedirect Funding from Planned Parenthood to Health Centers not Entangled with Abortion Services. Planned Parenthood Federation of America affiliates face serious and disturbing accusations that should spur Congress to redirect the organization\u2019s federal funding to other health centers for women. Some affiliates have been shown in videos selling the body parts of aborted babies, while others face accusations of waste, abuse, and potential fraud with taxpayer money, and still others of failing to report the sexual abuse of minor girls.[31]\n\nNo federal funds should go to Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any of its affiliates or health centers. Disqualifying Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving Title X family planning grants, Medicaid reimbursements, and other grants and contracts should not reduce the overall funding for women\u2019s health care. The funds currently flowing to Planned Parenthood affiliates should be distributed to health centers that offer comprehensive health care without entanglement in abortion on demand.\n\nRestrict Risk-Corridor Funding. Section 1342 of the Affordable Care Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to operate a risk-corridor program to limit the profits and losses of qualified health plans in the individual and small-group markets. However, the provision does not specify a source of funding for the program. As part of the Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act of 2015,[32] Congress restricted funding for the risk-corridor program to money collected from participating profitable health plans. Congress should prohibit risk-corridor funding in order to prevent the program from being bailed out by the Administration.\n\nDirect the Department of Education to Rescind the \u201cGainful Employment\u201d Regulations Promulgated on For-Profit Higher-Education Institutions. The Higher Education Act stipulates that in order to be eligible for federal student aid, colleges must prepare students for \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation.\u201d The U.S. Department of Education has aggressively promulgated rules concerning gainful employment during the Obama Administration, and as of July 1, 2015, a gainful employment regulation primarily affecting for-profit institutions went into effect. The rule could limit opportunities for non-traditional students in particular, who may choose a for-profit institution because of its flexibility and affordability. A new Administration should enable private for-profit and vocational colleges to continue to serve students who have been historically underserved by traditional universities by repealing the gainful employment regulations that went into effect on July 1, 2015.\n\nProtect Freedom of Conscience in Health Care. Congress should maintain all existing pro-life policy riders that prevent federal funding from being entangled with the provision, coverage, or advocacy of abortion both here and abroad. In addition, Congress should codify prohibitions on government agencies and programs funded with federal money discriminating against health care providers, organizations, and health insurance plans because they do not perform, pay for, refer, or provide coverage for abortions. Congress should also allow victims-of-conscience violations to be vindicated in court.\n\nSince 2004, the Weldon Amendment has prohibited federal, state, and local governments that receive certain federal funds from discriminating against health care entities, including health care plans that decline to \u201cprovide, pay for, provide coverage of or refer for abortions.\u201d[33] Enforcement of the conscience policy, however, is left to the discretion of officials in the Department of Health and Human Services, which has a poor track record of moving quickly (if at all) on complaints.[34]\n\nThe need to codify these conscience protections and provide victims a better path to relief is urgent. In August 2014, the Department of Managed Health Care in California mandated that almost every health plan in the state include coverage of elective abortions, including those plans offered by religious organizations, religious schools\u2014even churches.[35] Requests to Health and Human Services officials to review the state\u2019s mandate have so far gone unanswered by the Obama Administration. Policymakers should not wait for more assaults on conscience before protecting the freedom of every American to provide, find, or offer health care and health insurance coverage that aligns with his values.\n\nStipulate the Use of Fair-Value Accounting. In order for taxpayers to have a clear understanding of the costs of federal higher-education subsidies, policymakers should direct the Department of Education to use fair-value accounting. Fair-value estimates take market risk into account, and are a better reflection of the true costs of federal higher-education subsidies for student loans. Without the use of fair-value accounting, it is difficult to know whether federal loan programs are using non-subsidizing interest rates, which they should use in order for the loans to break even. Absent fair-value accounting, it is impossible to know the extent to which student loan programs are providing a subsidy to borrowers. Congress should require the Department of Education to use fair-value accounting estimates calculated by the Congressional Budget Office and adjust loan rates accordingly, and on a yearly basis.\n\nEliminate the Cap on Coverdell Savings Accounts. Coverdell savings accounts help families save for their children\u2019s K\u201312 education (such as private school tuition) by allowing interest on funds deposited into the accounts by families to accrue tax-free, as long as it is put toward approved education expenditures. Although this is a beneficial savings vehicle for families who want to save to pay for their own children\u2019s education expenses, annual account contributions are capped at $2,000, limiting their power to help defray private school and other K\u201312 expenses. The annual contribution cap on Coverdell accounts should be eliminated.\n\nHalt Implementation of the Union-Persuader Regulations. The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) is considering regulations requiring almost all lawyers who consult with companies during union organizing drives to file detailed financial disclosure forms. These forms would require listing all clients and detailing the substance of communications with them. This disclosure violates the attorney-client confidentiality standards to which the American Bar Association holds its members. They would discourage lawyers from providing legal advice to companies during union organizing battles and increase the likelihood that businesses commit unfair labor practices. Congress should deny funding for OLMS to promulgate or enforce these new \u201cpersuader\u201d regulations.[36]\n\nHalt Implementation of OSHA Recordkeeping Regulations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has proposed to publicly report the workplace injuries that occur at major employers, identifying the employers and incident by name. This disclosure could lead to revealing the identities of workers injured on the job and would discourage businesses from accurately reporting on-the-job injuries. Congress should deny funding for OSHA to promulgate or enforce these recordkeeping regulations.\n\nHalt Implementation of New Overtime Regulations. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the Department of Labor has proposed requiring businesses to pay overtime rates to salaried employees earning less than $50,000 a year. Employers will offset these higher costs with base salary cuts, leaving total pay little changed. However, these regulations will force employers to log salaried employees\u2019 hours. This will sharply restrict many salaried employees\u2019 ability to work remotely because businesses have difficulty logging hours worked outside the office. This will reduce the flexibility of workers\u2019 hours and make it more difficult to juggle work and family lives. Congress should deny funding for the WHD to promulgate or enforce these new overtime regulations.[37]\n\nStop the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from Using the Joint Employer Redefinition. For decades, the NLRB held that two employers jointly employed a worker\u2014and had to bargain with a union\u2014if they both exercised immediate and direct control over the employee\u2019s work. The Obama NLRB redefined that standard to determine that joint employment exists when a company has \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cunexercised,\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d control over working conditions. This makes most businesses that hire contractors and franchised brands joint employers of their contractors\u2019 and franchisees\u2019 employees. If it survives legal scrutiny, this redefinition will gut the franchise business model. If corporate brands are legally responsible for their franchisees\u2019 hiring actions, they need to control them. They will respond by replacing locally owned franchises with corporate stores, eliminating a key source of access to small-business ownership. Congress should deny funding to the NLRB for prosecuting any unfair labor practices under its new joint employer standards.[38]\n\nGive Workers Time to Make an Informed Choice in Union Elections. The NLRB recently implemented \u201cambush election\u201d rules, shortening the time for union elections to approximately three weeks.[39] Workers should have more than three weeks to consider arguments on both sides and make an informed choice. Congress should deny the NLRB funding to implement the \u201cambush election\u201d regulations and require the board to take at least five weeks between the election petition and final vote, unless both the union and employer agree otherwise.[40]\n\nStop Gerrymandered Bargaining Units. Historically, unions organized bargaining units composed of workers with a community interest, such as the hourly workers under the direction of the same general manager. The NLRB has recently begun allowing unions to organize workers by job title. For example, the NLRB recently ordered a union election among just the cosmetics and fragrance employees at a Macy\u2019s department store. No other workers in the store were allowed to vote. This new standard allows unions to gerrymander bargaining units to exclude employees who think the risks of unionizing outweigh the benefits. If the union calls a strike it will nonetheless affect jobs. Unions should not have the power to selectively disenfranchise workers who oppose unionizing. Congress should deny the NLRB funding to hold elections in micro-bargaining units, or to prosecute charges of unfair labor practice for employers refusing to recognize micro-bargaining units.[41]\n\nLegislative Branch\n\nCongress should:\n\nEliminate Funding for Special Congressional Subsidies for Health Insurance in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurance Exchange. Under Section 1312 D of the ACA, Congress voted itself out of insurance coverage in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and required Members and staff to obtain their health coverage through the law\u2019s health insurance exchange program.[42]\n\nWhen Members of Congress realized that, in enacting Obamacare in 2010, they had voted themselves and their staffs out of their own health coverage, many urgently tried to find a way out of their predicament, preferably in the form of an administrative solution that would avoid the embarrassment of a recorded vote on the floor of the House or the Senate.[43]\n\nPresident Obama provided regulatory relief in 2013: the provision of special taxpayer subsidies for Congress and staff to offset their higher insurance costs in the law\u2019s new health insurance exchange. On August 7, 2013, the Office of Personnel Management ruled that Members of Congress and staff, even though they are no longer enrolled in the FEHBP, would henceforth receive FEHBP subsidies for coverage outside the FEHBP in the exchanges. The Administration took this regulatory action without statutory authority under either the Affordable Care Act or Title V, the law that governs the FEHBP. In effect, to reduce the additional costs of health coverage in the exchange, OPM provided a special set of subsidies to Members and staff that are not available to any other class of American citizens. The Administration\u2019s decision was both illegal and inequitable.[44]\n\nState, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies\n\nCongress should:\n\nRequire Senate Participation in the Paris Protocol Agreement. Congress should make no funds available to implement, administer, or enforce the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Any agreement made must be submitted as a treaty to the Senate. President Obama has committed the U.S. to greenhouse gas emissions cuts of 26 percent to 28 percent (from 2005 levels) by 2025 as part of a United Nations climate agreement in Paris. To achieve the goal, the Obama Administration proposed a package of regulations, which it is already well underway in implementing: fuel efficiency mandates for cars and trucks, energy efficiency mandates, methane emissions regulations, an executive order to cut emissions and energy use by the federal government, and the capstone Clean Power Plan regulating state carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe U.S. should not supply funds in any fashion to the U.N. climate agreement or climate banks unless and until the Senate is provided the opportunity to give advice and consent to an international climate change agreement. The U.S. should commit to free-market principles that will provide affordable, reliable energy, as opposed to government-picked technologies and energy sources. These have a greater and long-lasting impact on alleviating poverty and creating economic opportunities for impoverished communities.[45]\n\nExpand Sanctions on Iran. Congress should immediately reinstate all U.S. sanctions on Iran suspended under the Vienna Agreement and work with Congress to expand sanctions, focusing on Iran\u2019s nuclear program; support of terrorism; ballistic missile program; interventions in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen; human rights violations; and holding of four American hostages ((1) Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, (2) Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, (3) former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, and (4) former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who has been covertly held hostage by the Iranian regime since 2007).\n\nThe next Administration should designate Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization and apply sanctions to any non-Iranian companies that do business with the IRGC\u2019s extensive economic empire. This measure would help reduce the IRGC\u2019s ability to exploit sanctions relief for its own hostile purposes.\n\nWashington should also cite Iranian violations of the accord as reason for re-imposing U.N. sanctions on Iran, thus enhancing international pressure on Tehran and discouraging foreign investment and trade that could boost Iran\u2019s military and nuclear programs. It is critical that U.S. allies and Iran\u2019s trading partners understand that investing or trading with Iran will subject them to U.S. sanctions even if some countries refuse to enforce U.N. sanctions.\n\nStrengthen U.S. Alliances, Especially with Israel. The nuclear agreement has had a corrosive effect on bilateral relationships with important U.S. allies in the Middle East, particularly those countries that are most threatened by Iran\u2014Israel and Saudi Arabia. Rather than sacrificing the interests of allies in a rush to embrace Iran, as the Obama Administration has done, the next Administration should give priority to safeguarding the vital security interests of the U.S. and its allies by maintaining a favorable balance of power in the region to deter and contain Iran. Washington should help rebuild security ties by boosting arms sales to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council that are threatened by Tehran, taking care that arms sales to Arab states do not threaten Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge in the event of a flare-up in Arab\u2013Israeli fighting.\n\nTo enhance deterrence against an Iranian nuclear breakout, Washington also should transfer capabilities to Israel that could be used to destroy hardened targets, such as the Fordow uranium-enrichment facility, which is built hundreds of feet beneath a mountain. The only non-nuclear weapon capable of destroying such a target is the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a precision-guided, 30,000-pound \u201cbunker buster\u201d bomb. Giving Israel these weapons and the aircraft to deliver them would make Tehran think twice about risking a nuclear breakout.\n\nThe U.S. and its European allies also should strengthen military, intelligence, and security cooperation with Israel and the members of the GCC\u2014an alliance of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, founded in 1981 to provide collective security for Arab states threatened by Iran. Such a coalition could help both to contain the expansion of Iranian power and to facilitate military action (if necessary) against Iran.\n\nProhibit Funding of International Abortion Groups and Eliminate Funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Congress should set a cap for federal funding of international family planning programs and ensure that no money is sent to organizations that perform or promote abortion.\n\nIn January 2009, President Obama rescinded the Mexico City policy[46]\u2014a 1984 directive by the Reagan Administration that prohibited certain federal dollars from going to international organizations that promote or perform abortions. Since then, the U.S. has allocated at least $3.6 billion in funding for international family planning programs without the necessary safeguards of the Mexico City policy. That leaves groups like International Planned Parenthood Federation, which reported that its member associations performed over 1 million abortions in 2013 alone,[47] eligible for funding by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nCongress should eliminate funding for UNFPA. From 1985 to 2008, the U.S. withheld funding to UNFPA under the Kemp\u2013Kasten Amendment, which allows the President to prohibit U.S. international aid from supporting programs that promote coercive abortion procedures or involuntary sterilization.[48] However, the Obama Administration restored funding to UNFPA in January 2009. The U.S. has since sent over $250 million in taxpayer dollars to the organization, despite continued assertions that the UNFPA has been involved in China\u2019s coercive one-child policy.[49]\n\nEnforce the U.S. Cap on Contributions to United Nations Peacekeeping. The President is requesting $2.5 billion for Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities, which pays for the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. This is a 43 percent increase over FY 2014. Some of this increase reflects increased costs associated with newly established or expanded missions. However, a significant portion of the increase results from the Administration seeking to pay 28.4 percent of the U.N. peacekeeping budget instead of the 25 percent maximum signed into law in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. A decade ago, Congress agreed to pay U.S. arrears under the 1999 Helms\u2013Biden agreement in return for assurances that the U.N. would lower the U.S. peacekeeping assessment to 25 percent. Instead, the U.N. has raised the U.S. assessment repeatedly since 2010. Congress and the Obama Administration encouraged these reversals through amendments to U.S. law allowing payments above 25 percent. The U.S. should resume pressure on the U.N. to lower the U.S. peacekeeping assessment to 25 percent by refusing to pay more than this amount, and by tying payment of any resulting arrears to adoption by the U.N. of a maximum peacekeeping assessment of 25 percent.[50]\n\nMaintain the Prohibition on Funding U.N. Organizations that Grant Full Membership to the Palestinians. Current law prohibits U.S. funds from going to international organizations that grant full membership to the Palestinian territories. Although the Palestinians have threatened to seek membership in other U.N. specialized agencies, the only organization currently affected by this prohibition is the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which granted the Palestinians full membership in 2011. The Administration has been seeking authority to waive this restriction since then. Waiving the restriction would reward UNESCO for its imprudent action and remove the most significant incentive for other organizations not to grant membership to the Palestinians.[51]\n\nCut Funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA was established more than 60 years ago as a temporary initiative to address the needs of Palestinian refugees and to facilitate their resettlement or repatriation. It has become a permanent institution providing services to multiple generations of Palestinians, a large majority of whom live outside refugee camps, enjoy citizenship in other countries, or reside in the Palestinian-governed territories. Despite the presence of and activities funded through UNRWA, the Palestinian refugee problem has only grown larger, in part due to UNRWA\u2019s expanding definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d The U.S. should encourage reform and replacement of UNRWA to facilitate its original purpose.[52]\n\nExpand Food Aid Reforms. U.S. law requires that most food assistance be purchased from U.S. producers and shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels. This policy is inefficient, costly, and shortsighted. To increase efficiency and responsiveness, the President is seeking to exempt 25 percent of this food assistance from these requirements, which the Administration estimates could result in an additional 2 million beneficiaries with the same resources. While these reforms are welcome, the proposal falls far short of the potential benefit. Congress should eliminate these requirements entirely to maximize the impact of these programs and, through efficiency gains, trim the budget while benefiting more people.[53]\n\nOppose International Monetary Fund (IMF) Reforms. The budget seeks congressional support for changes in the financial structure and governance of the IMF negotiated in 2010. The package would shift resources from an IMF supplementary fund, the New Arrangements to Borrow, to the IMF\u2019s quota resources where the U.S. has less influence than it does now. It would also allow the IMF membership to overrule the President\u2019s candidate for the U.S. seat on the IMF executive board.[54]\n\nIncrease Oversight of International Organizations. United Nations system revenues nearly tripled between 2002 and 2012, and the U.N. received a total of more than $312 billion over that period. The U.S. has been and remains the U.N. system\u2019s largest contributor, providing an average of about one-fifth of total contributions annually over that period\u2014totaling approximately $60 billion in eight years. Congress should demand that the Administration conduct a cost\u2013benefit analysis of U.S. participation in all international organizations, enact a permanent annual reporting requirement for all U.S. contributions to the U.N. system to be conducted by the Office of Management and Budget, and establish a dedicated unit for international organizations in the Office of Inspector General for the Department of State.[55]\n\nProvisions that Fall Under More than One Appropriations Subcommittee\n\nCongress should:\n\nMaintain Existing Definition of \u201cFill Material\u201d or \u201cDischarge of Fill Material\u201d under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Regulations. Under the Clean Water Act, permits may be required for certain activities that could impact waters across the U.S. The Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency may redefine \u201cfill material\u201d or \u201cdischarge of fill material\u201d in a manner that would require mining companies to secure Section 402 permits, as opposed to Section 404 permits, for various mining activities.[56] While there are certainly obstacles to securing Section 404 permits, Section 402 permits are even more stringent, and industry groups have argued that it would effectively prohibit numerous mining activities.[57] Existing regulations provide ample environmental protection without imposing unnecessary restrictions that could harm the mining industry and the communities that benefit from mining operations.[58] Subcommittees: Energy and Water; Interior and Environment\n\nLimit Application of the Recapture Provision for Dredge-and-Fill Permits. Under the CWA, Section 404 permits are not required for normal farming activities, construction of stock ponds, and other related activities. However, there are exceptions, including under what is referred to as the \u201crecapture\u201d provision.[59] In recent testimony, the American Farm Bureau Federation explained this provision:\n\n[W]here discharges of dredged or fill material are used to bring land into a new use (e.g. making wetlands amenable to farming) and impair the reach or reduce the scope of jurisdictional waters, those discharges are not exempt. The Agencies have broadly interpreted the \u201crecapture\u201d provision to apply even when the \u201cnew use\u201d is simply a change from one crop to another crop.[60]\n\nBy limiting the application of the recapture provision, Congress can help to prevent the weakening of the exemptions that are critical for farmers and ranchers.[61] Subcommittees: Energy and Water; Interior and Environment\n\nRestrict Federal Grants to Sanctuary Cities. Congress should prohibit the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice from providing grant money to cities that resist the enforcement of immigration law, known as sanctuary cities. Federalism gives local governments some latitude in choosing to oppose or not assist the federal government in enforcing immigration law, but the federal government does not have to reward or pay for the results of such policies. Subcommittees: Homeland Security; Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\nDeter Nuclear Proliferation. For more than five decades, Washington has opposed the spread of sensitive nuclear technologies, such as uranium enrichment, even for its allies. By unwisely making an exception for Iran, the Obama Administration in effect conceded the acceptability of an illicit uranium-enrichment program in a rogue state. In fact, the Administration granted Iran\u2019s Islamist dictatorship better terms on uranium enrichment than the Ford and Carter Administrations offered to the Shah of Iran, a U.S. ally in the 1970s. Subcommittees: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Activities; Energy and Water\n\nProhibit Government Discrimination in Tax Policy, Grants, Contracting, and Accreditation. Congress should prohibit funding of any federal agency or program that discriminates against any individual or group in tax policy, grants, contracts, licensing, or accreditation, based on the individual or group\u2019s belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman or that sexual relations are reserved for such a marriage.[62] Preventing discrimination in this way does not relieve the federal government of its duty to provide any benefit or service under federal law. Subcommittees: all\n\nProhibit Any Agency from Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The Obama Administration has proposed and implemented a series of climate change regulations, pushing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, airplanes, hydraulic fracturing, and new and existing power plants. More than 80 percent of America\u2019s energy needs are met through conventional carbon-based fuels. Restricting opportunities for Americans to use such an abundant, affordable energy source will only bring economic pain to households and businesses\u2014with no climate or environmental benefit to show for it. The cumulative economic loss will be hundreds of thousands of jobs and trillions of dollars of gross domestic product. Subcommittees: Interior and Environment; Energy and Water\n\nProhibit Funding for WOTUS. The EPA and Army Corps\u2019 controversial \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d (WOTUS) rule would greatly expand the types of waters that could be covered under the Clean Water Act from certain man-made ditches to so-called waters that are actually dry land most of the time. The appropriations process is particularly critical for addressing this rule because President Obama has already indicated that he would veto stand-alone legislation to repeal the rule.[63] Absent congressional action, this attack on property rights and state power could soon move forward. Fortunately, the Sixth Circuit Court issued a stay,[64] blocking implementation of the rule, but this may be short-lived; the court has not yet determined if it even has jurisdiction in the case.[65] Subcommittees: Energy and Water; Interior and Environment\n\nEnforce Data Quality as Congress Intended. No funds should be used for any grant for which the recipient does not agree to make all data produced under the grant publicly available in a manner consistent with the Data Access Act, and in compliance with the standards of the Information Quality Act. The Data Access Act requires federal agencies to ensure that data produced under grants to and agreements with universities, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations is available to the public. The Information Quality Act requires the Office of Management and Budget \u201cto promulgate guidance to agencies ensuring the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.\u201d[66] However, the Office of Management and Budget has unduly restricted the Data Access Act, and there is little accountability that could ensure agency compliance with the Information Quality Act. Credible science and transparency are necessary elements of sound policy.[67] Subcommittees: Interior and Environment; Energy and Water; Commerce, Justice, Science\n\nWithhold Grants for Seizure of Private Property. On June 23, 2005, the United States Supreme Court held in Kelo v. City of New London that the government may seize private property and transfer it to another private party for economic development. This type of taking was deemed to be for a \u201cpublic use\u201d and allowed under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Congress has failed to take meaningful action in the decade since this landmark decision and should provide property owners in all states necessary protection from economic-development and closely related takings, such as blight-related takings.\n\nSince there is a subjective element to determining whether a taking is for economic development, the condemnor should be required to establish that a taking would not have occurred but for the economic-development reason. Local governments often use broad definitions of \u201cblight\u2019 to seize private property, including seizing property that is not blighted but is located in an allegedly blighted area. Only property that itself is legitimately blighted, such as posing a concrete harm to health and safety, should be allowed to be seized. Congress should withhold grants for infrastructure development to states or other jurisdictions that invoke eminent domain to seize private property for economic development, unless the condemnor can demonstrate that the taking would have occurred but for economic development and is for a public use, or to address blight unless the property itself poses a concrete harm to health and safety.[68] Subcommittees: Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration; Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; Financial Services and General Government; Interior and Environment; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education; Legislative Branch; State, Foreign Operations; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBlock Dietary Guidelines Based on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. Every five years, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services issue dietary guidelines to advise the public on healthy eating.[69] The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) submitted its scientific report, which helps to inform the final guidelines, in February 2015.[70] Throughout the DGAC process, there has been a focus on non-dietary issues, such as sustainability, climate change, and other environmental factors. Practically, any new Dietary Guidelines will have no legitimacy because the DGAC was allowed to veer off its mission and act more like environmental activists than experts focusing on the best nutritional advice for Americans. If there are to be new guidelines, the agencies should be required to go back to the drawing board with a new DGAC process that focuses exclusively on nutrition. Subcommittees: Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education\n\nEnd All Energy Subsidies. No taxpayer dollars should be used for energy production, storage, efficiency, infrastructure, or transportation for nongovernment consumers, including the extension of existing programs. Targeted energy subsidies significantly obstruct the long-term success and viability of the very technologies and energy sources that they were intended to promote. Instead of relying on a process that rewards competition, taxpayer subsidies prevent a company from truly understanding the price point at which the technology will be economically viable. An energy sector based on free enterprise would benefit consumers by delivering reliable, affordable energy while eliminating government favoritism to special interests.[71] Subcommittees: Energy and Water; Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration", "Under a bill by Texas State Representative Geanie W. Morrison (R- Victoria), co-authored by Rep. Ron Simmons (R-Carrollton), rulings by judges in judicial bypass cases will no longer be kept from the public. Such rulings would be included in a report by the Texas Office of Court Administration which is made public annually. The name of the minor involved would be kept anonymous.\n\nTexas law provides that pregnant minors may go before a judge to request abortions without notifying their parents, managing conservators, or guardians. The law also stipulates procedures to be followed during these court proceedings. Until now, the names of the judges and the details of their rulings have been kept confidential, along with the names of the minors involved.\n\nCounty court at law (criminal and civil), district (criminal and civil), probate, and family court judges all have jurisdiction over these cases.\n\nH.B. 3994 requires the clerk of the court, at intervals to be defined by the Texas Office of Court Administration (OCA), to submit a report to the office that includes the case number; style of the case; the minor applicant\u2019s county of residence; the court in which the proceeding occurred; date of filing; date of disposition; and the disposition of the case. The OCA would, in turn, be required to compile and publish a report annually. The bill requires all parties to \u201cprotect the anonymity of all minors that are the subject of the report.\u201d\n\nRep. Ron Simmons had authored a similar bill, H.B. 1942, but pulled it on Wednesday to lend support to Morrison\u2019s bill, as Morrison\u2019s bill had already been reported favorably out of committee.\n\nRep. Simmons told Breitbart Texas that at this late stage in the session, he chose to become a joint author to H.B. 1942 because\u201dboth bills share the goal of saving as many unborn lives as possible, and ensuring the integrity of the judicial bypass process.\u201d\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas. Follow her on Twitter @LanaShadwick2", "The House of Representatives has moved to defund the controversial civil forfeiture practice known as \u201cadoptive\u201d seizures.\n\nLast week, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to approve three amendments to the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, all of which would prevent federal funds from being used to implement Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 July order to restart adoptive forfeitures.\n\nThis makes the 2018 appropriations bill\u2014which passed the House last Thursday\u2014one of the most significant federal legislative actions on civil forfeiture in years.\n\nAdoptive forfeiture is the process by which property allegedly tied to criminal wrongdoing can be seized by state and local law enforcement officials, and then handed off to federal authorities for forfeiture under comparatively lax federal law.\n\nIf a forfeiture is successful, the original seizing agency can expect to receive up to 80 percent of the resulting proceeds through the \u201cequitable sharing\u201d program.\n\nThis program has come under tremendous pressure in recent years as states began to rein in civil forfeiture, afford property owners greater due process protections, and restrict how much forfeiture revenue may be retained by local law enforcement authorities and how those funds may be spent.\n\nCritics contend that adoptive forfeitures made it all too easy for local and state agencies to circumvent these protections. One 2011 studyconcluded that an inverse relationship exists between state forfeiture laws and federal equitable sharing payments\u2014that is, the more a state attempts to limit police self-financing, the more agencies turn to federal forfeiture to make up the shortfalls.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder responded to this critique in 2015 by barring most adoptive forfeitures. In July, citing the need to combat ongoing violent and drug-related crime, Sessions ordered that adoptions be reinstated.\n\nIt is certainly refreshing to hear an attorney general speak candidly of the need to support our law enforcement officials as they do the difficult and dangerous job of safeguarding society. But restarting adoptive forfeitures\u2014even with the limitations and protections described in Sessions\u2019 order\u2014is a step in the wrong direction.\n\nIt is impossible to ignore the alarming effect of the financial incentive, which has led some law enforcement agencies to treat forfeiture as a revenue-generating tool. The result has been the seizure of cash and property from innocent people, and the release of likely criminals in exchange for the funds in their possession.\n\nThe decision by the Justice Department to begin adoptive forfeitures anew came amid a nationwide sea change in attitudes toward civil forfeiture. After ramping up civil forfeiture at the state and federal levels for decades, 24 states have adopted measures restricting the practice, or banning it altogether.\n\nEarlier this year, Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of modern forfeiture law. He noted he was \u201cskeptical\u201d that the limited practice of civil forfeiture known to the Founders could support, \u201cas a constitutional matter, the contours of the modern practice.\u201d\n\nNow, federal lawmakers are taking aim at forfeiture as well.\n\nLast week, the House passed the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act to bar the detestable IRS practice of seizing money not because it was earned illegally, but because the funds were \u201cstructured\u201d into payments of less than $10,000 to avoid financial reporting requirements\u2014even though there may be perfectly legitimate business reasons to make regular deposits in amounts less than $10,000.\n\nThe bill, named for three small business owners who collectively lost hundreds of thousands of dollars simply because the funds were \u201cstructured,\u201d would require that prosecutors demonstrate probable cause that seized funds are either illegally earned or structured to conceal illegal activity before they can proceed with a forfeiture case.\n\nThe passage of the RESPECT Act was followed up with three separate amendments to an appropriations bill defunding the attorney general\u2019s adoptive forfeiture order.\n\nThe first, by Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., prohibits funding for any seizure or forfeiture activity that would violate the 2015 order put in place by Holder.\n\nTwo others, introduced by Reps. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., prohibit the use of funds to implement Sessions\u2019 directive that rescinded the 2015 order.\n\nAll three amendments, as well as the RESPECT Act, passed the lower chamber on a voice vote, which signals broad\u2014indeed, virtually unanimous\u2014support for a measure among lawmakers.\n\nThis bodes well for the future of forfeiture reform in Congress.\n\nTwo other measures have been introduced in both the House and Senate. The FAIR Act would eliminate the financial incentive in forfeiture law, including the equitable sharing program. The DUE PROCESS Act, meanwhile, concentrates on strengthening due process protections for innocent property owners, helping to rebalance a system that is stacked against them in every meaningful way.\n\nAfter months of inaction, the last two weeks have proven that there remains cause for optimism in the fight for civil forfeiture reform.", "The U.S. patent system, rooted in the Constitution, plays a key role in American innovation and economic growth. Regrettably, evidence strongly suggests that recent changes in U.S. court decisions and in statutory patent law (coupled with a more skeptical attitude toward the patent system by antitrust enforcers here and abroad) have devalued American patents overall by making it more difficult to obtain and defend them. Reflecting this development, there are indications that American innovators are increasingly turning to other jurisdictions to secure patent protection, threatening to undermine America\u2019s lead role in generating the technological breakthroughs that will promote emerging industries and expand economic welfare in the future.\n\nThese recent changes are consistent with economic theory that underscores the value of a robust patent system, as well as recent international economic evidence that those nations with the strongest patent protection tend to have higher rates of economic expansion and innovation. Targeted congressional legislation, coupled with Trump Administration policy changes reflecting a better appreciation for the patent system\u2019s attributes, would help reclaim the U.S. patent system\u2019s former role as a driver of U.S. economic success.\n\nBackground[REF]\n\nThe Intellectual Property Clause (IP Clause) of the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\u201d[REF] Constitutional history indicates that the Framers understood inventors as having a private property interest in the fruits of the innovations produced by their labor (a form of \u201cintellectual property\u201d) and provided a specific means for that interest to be protected through legislation enacted pursuant to the IP Clause.\n\nReflecting that understanding, and underscoring the importance of the patent-property interest, the first Congress in 1790 enacted a law providing for the issuance and protection of patents. Subsequent Congresses built on that initial law and expanded the scope of patent protection, and early Supreme Court jurisprudence manifests a clear and consistent understanding that patents are valuable property and merit great respect. Thus, the firm recognition and robust support of a patent system to encourage innovation is rooted in our constitutional system.\n\nThe importance of patents has not diminished over time. To the contrary, patents played a central role in supporting the industrial revolution in 19th-century America and were associated with key U.S. innovative breakthroughs in the 20th and early 21st century as well. Throughout these periods, litigation over the boundaries of patent rights played a central role in the sorting out of legal rights in new industries. Indeed, lawsuits went hand-in-hand with patent-enabled breakthroughs that allowed for the introduction and widespread adoption of new products that fundamentally transformed American industry (sewing machines in the 1800s; telephones, airplanes, and electrical equipment in the 1900s; and smartphones in the 2000s\u2014just to name a few).[REF] Over the 1995\u20132015 period, patent licensing by academic and nonprofit institutions contributed $1.33 trillion to U.S. gross industry output; $591 billion to the gross domestic product; and supported 4,272,000 American jobs.[REF] While individual patents consistently have been the subject of legal disputes over time, patents as a whole have clearly been at the heart of successive waves of critically important American commercial innovation and continue to make enormous contributions to the American economy.\n\nI. An Overview of Patents and Recent Court Decisions Affecting the U.S. Patent System[REF]\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), an agency within the U.S. Commerce Department, examines patent applications and issues patents that it determines meet the statutory criteria for patentability.[REF] Also, upon request by third parties, the PTO conducts \u201csecond look\u201d reviews of issued patents to determine if they should have been issued or not.\n\nA patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor. A patent may contain a variety of specific \u201cclaims\u201d that define the precise subject matter that is protected by the patent. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. U.S. patent grants are effective only within the United States, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions: In short, patent rights are national in scope. Once a patent is issued, it (similar to other private property rights) is enforced by its owner, not by the PTO. When a patent is granted, key information related to the patented invention is published, adding to the stock of valuable, publicly available technical information. This information is a public good: It facilitates the efforts of third parties to develop their own innovations and thereby spurs technological development and economic growth.\n\nAs the U.S. Patent Act[REF] explains, a patent confers \u201cthe right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling\u201d the invention in the United States or \u201cimporting\u201d the invention into the United States. A patent grant neither requires nor prohibits the patent owner from using his patent to make or sell a good or service. In other words, the right to exclude lies at the heart of a patent.\n\nPatent infringement is the act of making, using, selling, or offering to sell a patented invention, or importing into the United States a product covered by a claim of a patent, without the permission of the patent owner.[REF] A patent owner can sue a party it believes has infringed his patent in federal court. If the patent owner is able to prove infringement, the court may order the infringer to pay the owner monetary damages and/or to stop infringing one or more patent claims (an injunction). When damages[REF] are awarded, they shall \u201cin no event [be] less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer.\u201d Additionally, the court may increase the damages up to three times the actual damages suffered if it finds an infringement was \u201cknowing, deliberate, intentional, willful, or wanton,\u201d but this very rarely occurs. A court may also hold that a patent has not been infringed, or is invalid, because Patent Act requirements for patentability have not been met.\n\nThe Patent Act specifies that to be patentable, a claimed invention must be: (1) patent eligible, (2) useful, (3) novel, (4) non-obvious, and (5) described sufficiently well so that people skilled in the field can make and use it (enablement). Failure to meet any of these conditions precludes receipt of a patent. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have made it harder to satisfy the second and fourth criteria\u2014usefulness and non-obviousness, respectively\u2014thereby making it more difficult for American inventors to obtain a U.S. patent.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has greatly diminished the ability of a patent owner to obtain an injunction to prevent third parties from infringing his or her patent rights. Finally, and most recently, the Supreme Court undermined the ability of a patent holder to guarantee that his patent rights would be respected when products embodying the patent are resold by the initial purchaser (patent exhaustion). These developments pose a real threat to U.S. innovation and the future vitality of the American economy.\n\nA. Patent Eligibility. Section 101 of the Patent Act, which governs patent eligibility, plainly states that \u201c[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the [other] conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d[REF]\n\nThis language basically says that everything made through human intervention is patentable. For many years, however, the Supreme Court has recognized three judicially created exceptions to patent eligibility, providing that you cannot patent: (1) laws of nature, (2) natural phenomena, or (3) abstract ideas. Even with these exceptions (which learned critics point out have no basis in the Patent Act\u2019s language[REF]), the scope for patentability was quite broad from 1952 (when the modern version of the Patent Act was codified) until roughly 2010.[REF]\n\nBut over the past decade, the Supreme Court has cut back significantly on what it deems patent eligible, particularly in such areas as biotechnology, computer-implemented inventions, and software. As a result, today \u201cthere are many other parts of the world that have more expansive views of what can be patented, including Europe, Australia, and even China.\u201d[REF] Reflecting this change in circumstances, a 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranking of national patent systems found that the United States has slipped to number 10 in the world (tied with Hungary), after having been ranked number one in prior rankings.[REF]\n\nSenator Christopher Coons (D\u2013DE), who has proposed patent reform legislation, succinctly summarized the nature of the problem:\n\nUntil recently, Section 101 of the Patent Act of 1952 acted as a coarse filter, with the remaining patentability requirements of Title 35 [the U.S. statutory patent provisions] doing the heavy lifting on whether a patent should issue. This arrangement let examination focus on whether the inventor had disclosed enough information and whether he or she had made a sufficient advancement in science or technology. Over the last eight years, however, a series of Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 have substantially moved the line on what is patent-eligible. These rulings have created uncertainty about the validity of previously issued patents, many of which companies have already relied upon to justify significant research and development investments. Our current problem appears twofold. First, courts are calling into question whether patents should be granted at all to inventions made in critical areas of our innovation economy, namely medical diagnostics and computer software. Second, the manner in which case law has been developing is creating profound uncertainty on what is and what is not patentable. Whether or not one gets a patent or that patent survives in court should not depend on which patent examiner your case is assigned to, or what judge you appear in front of. Such ambiguity has serious implications in the investment sector, where confidence is essential. If we are regularly seeing such levels of inconsistency, then we have an area where the jurisprudence is insufficiently clear, and which may necessitate congressional action to provide clarity and consistency.[REF]\n\nSenator Coons went on to summarize the bad likely consequences of the newfound uncertainty regarding what is patentable subject matter: (1) reduced research and development, undermining American preeminence in emerging technologies; (2) direct harm to Americans, as lack of patentability slows the incentive to develop valuable innovative products (such as diagnostic tools for such costly and tragic diseases as Alzheimer\u2019s); (3) more reliance on trade secret protection instead of patent protection, inhibiting useful business collaborations and reducing the stock of innovation-inducing publicly available information;[REF] and (4) new ambiguity about what is patentable, yielding costly uncertainty for inventors, patent examiners, and judges.\n\nB. Usefulness (or \u201cUtility\u201d).[REF] Even if the eligible patentable subject matter criterion is met, the inventor must show that the invention is \u201cuseful\u201d for some purpose. Generally, this is a fairly low bar, and a patent applicant\u2019s assertion that his or her invention possesses \u201cutility\u201d for some purpose will be accepted unless: (1) it involves seriously flawed logic; or (2) the facts revealed by the applicant are at odds with the assertion of utility. (For example, a claim for a patent covering a \u201cperpetual motion machine\u201d would run afoul of basic scientific knowledge and logic.)\n\nC. Novelty.[REF] Section 102 of the Patent Act requires that a claimed invention be \u201cnovel,\u201d that is, not \u201canticipated\u201d by prior art. Under the \u201cfirst to file\u201d system that was adopted by the United States effective March 2013, a use, sale, or publication of the invention prior to the U.S. filing dates precludes patentability, but disclosures made by the inventor, or by others who derived their information from the inventor, do not bar patentability (i.e., do not count as \u201cprior art\u201d) as long as they occurred within 12 months of the patent filing date.\n\nD. Non-Obviousness.[REF] The requirement in Section 103 of the Patent Act that a claimed invention be \u201cnon-obvious\u201d has been described as meaning that it is \u201cnon-trivial.\u201d Courts have sought to determine whether a claim is \u201cnon-obvious\u201d by asking whether it would have been \u201cobvious\u201d to a \u201cperson having ordinary skill in the art.\u201d As a leading commentator has noted, \u201c[A]s hard as decision-makers may try the ultimate decision necessarily incorporates a certain amount of subjectivity.\u201d[REF] Nevertheless, until a decade ago, the \u201cnon-obviousness\u201d issue was viewed as involving the application of relatively straightforward criteria and was not deemed to be a major disincentive in deciding whether to file for a patent.\n\nThe uncertainty concerning whether a patent examiner or a court will find a patent covering an invention to be \u201cobvious,\u201d however, increased following the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 decision in KSR v. Teleflex.[REF] In that case, the Supreme Court struck down as \u201cobvious\u201d a patent covering an adjustable accelerator pedal assembly for an automobile that incorporated an electronic sensor for communication with the computer chip controlling the throttle in the car\u2019s engine. The Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Teleflex that inventions created \u201caccording to known methods\u2026[that] yield predictable results\u201d are obvious and thus unpatentable has been criticized as \u201cparticularly troubling because science progresses by predicting a result and applying known methods to test the prediction.\u201d[REF] In other words, this test in effect assumes a result is \u201cpredictable,\u201d without considering the complicated analysis and inventiveness often required in selecting alternative methods to frame a test and achieve a possible result.\n\nBy failing to provide helpful guidance as to whether a result will be deemed \u201cpredictable\u201d or not, the Supreme Court in Teleflex created a highly subjective test that injects confusion into the \u201cobviousness\u201d inquiry and is arguably at odds with the scientific method.[REF] The uncertainty spawned by Teleflex was predicted to raise legal costs and reduce incentives to invest in patentable research and development\u2014particularly for small inventors, who are less able to afford enhanced legal fees.[REF]\n\nA rise in the rejection of patents following Teleflex underscores the legitimacy of this concern. As one learned commentator recently explained, in the wake of Teleflex, \u201cjudges and patent examiners would proclaim obviousness by \u2018common sense\u2019 and by circular arguments that the combination is \u2018obvious\u2019 because it is \u2018obvious to try.\u2019 As a result, many more patents were found invalid for obviousness and many more patent applications failed to overcome rejections based on obviousness.\u201d[REF]\n\nE. Enablement.[REF] Section 112(a) of the Patent Act requires that a patent application contain:\n\n[A] written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.[REF]\n\nThis \u201cenablement\u201d requirement, which \u201cgoes back to the beginning of the [U.S.] patent system,\u201d is key to ensuring that patent grants expand the scope of useful technical knowledge. It specifies that a patent will be granted \u201con a new and non-obvious invention if and only if the inventor puts that invention into the possession of the public so that it can be understood and freely used by anyone and everyone once the patent expires.\u201d[REF] As such, the enablement requirement is relatively straightforward and a reasonable precondition to obtaining a patent.\n\nF. Judicial Obstacles to Obtaining an Injunction. A patent is a private property right, and, as such, an injunction\u2014an order forbidding an infringer from continuing to use the protected property\u2014was long the preferred remedy for patent infringement. The U.S. Supreme Court in its 2006 eBay v. MercExchange[REF] decision, however, overturned the long-established presumption in favor of granting an injunction when patent infringement is found by a federal trial court. Instead, the Supreme court in eBay held that the trial court should subjectively \u201cweigh the equities\u201d in order to determine whether the patent holder would likely suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d without an injunction.\n\nSince eBay, trial courts have granted an injunction after finding that a patent was valid and infringed in a far lower percentage of cases. The one comprehensive empirical study of eBay\u2019s impact on patent litigation (using a comprehensive database of pre- and post-eBay cases) shows that the decision dramatically reduced \u201cboth the level at which injunctive relief is sought in patent cases and the rate at which they are granted, particularly for preliminary injunctions.\u201d[REF] This has weakened patent rights. It has reduced patent infringers\u2019 incentive to settle lawsuits, knowing that, at most, they are likely to have to pay \u201creasonable royalties\u201d to the patent owner in the future if found liable. Moreover, it has raised the patent owner\u2019s direct costs of defending his or her property and, more generally, has played a central role in the erosion of patent rights:\n\nWithout the issuance of a permanent injunction the prevailing patent owner plaintiff is left to continually sue time and time again to seek redress for ongoing infringement. A well-funded infringing defendant could just keep on infringing and force the patent owner to expend many millions of dollars pursuing the infringer\u2026. The true mischief of the eBay decision\u2026[is] that the Supreme Court has taken the threat of a permanent injunction off the table. This means that infringers have no incentive to deal. Courts have already limited damages available to patent owners over the last decade. The courts have increasingly made it easier to challenge claims as being patent ineligible or obvious over the last decade. Congress has provided additional procedural mechanisms to more easily challenge patents after they have issued. Over the last decade there has been a significant erosion of patent rights. But the single most significant erosion of rights came in eBay.[REF]\n\nG. Patent Exhaustion. On May 30, 2017, in Impression Product v. Lexmark,[REF] the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated judicial uncertainty in enunciating a broad theory of \u201cpatent exhaustion\u201d that sharply limits restraints on resale imposed by a patent holder. Lexmark makes toner cartridges for printers and owns a number of patents that cover components of those cartridges and the manner in which they are used. Lexmark gave consumers two options: (1) Buy a toner cartridge at full price, with no restrictions; or (2) buy a cartridge at a discount, subject to a contractual agreement to use the cartridge only once and to refrain from transferring the cartridge to anyone but Lexmark. Lexmark sued for patent infringement a company that refilled and resold old Lexmark cartridges that had been purchased from Lexmark\u2019s discount buyers, who had violated their contractual agreement.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held that once Lexmark had sold its cartridges, it had \u201cexhausted\u201d its patent rights, and thus the re-filler/reseller of cartridges had not infringed its patent. The Court emphasized that allowing enforcement of a resale restriction under patent law would go beyond the point where patent rights must yield to the common-law principle against restraints on alienation. In so holding, the Court found that the \u201cexhaustion\u201d of Lexmark\u2019s patent rights after initial sale applied both to the discount program cartridges sold domestically and to those sold overseas.\n\nThe Lexmark decision is troublesome because it creates a disincentive for patent holders to engage in efficient contracts that allow it to cater to diverse customers that have different preferences as to how they want to utilize patented goods. As the Director of IP Policy at BIO, the major trade association for biopharmaceutical products, stated:\n\nThe Court\u2019s decision will change decades of established commercial practice essential to the U.S. economy. The Court provided no analysis of whether such sweeping changes are necessary or even beneficial\u2026. [T]he Court\u2019s decision greatly reduces the incentive for patentees to utilize conditional sales. This penalizes manufacturers who sell products at preferential prices to special users who could not otherwise afford the product. For example, manufacturers will have to rethink whether sales for \u201cresearch use only\u201d to universities at lower cost will continue to be commercially viable. This could make it more difficult for the end products of such research endeavors to be made available to the public.[REF]\n\nThe leading antitrust treatise writer, Professor Herbert Hovenkamp, expressed substantial concerns about the reasoning and negative policy implications of the Lexmark holding:\n\nLexmark was attempting to use patent law to impose a variable proportion tie\u2014in this case, a requirement that users of its printers also use its own original equipment toner cartridges. The general although not unanimous consensus is that such arrangements are economically beneficial, and largely everyone agrees that they are beneficial when the seller lacks market power, as Lexmark did in this case\u2026. Impression Products reveals an economic deficiency that manifests all too frequently when patent law is brought to bear on market practices. Economic concepts such as market power or output effects which are commonly used in antitrust law are virtually unknown in patent law\u2026. The Supreme Court based its patent exhaustion holding on concerns about restraints on alienation, which it presented as rooted in the common law. But the common law\u2019s rules on restraints on alienation are much more complex than the Supreme Court acknowledged. The common law typically upheld restraints that were limited in time, and restraints enforced by patent infringement actions are by definition limited by the life of the patent\u2026. [Thus] the Supreme Court would have been wise to develop a more nuanced exhaustion rule that examined actual effects likely to result from a particular restraint.[REF]\n\nThe bottom line is that the Supreme Court has weakened patents through a crabbed reading of common-law doctrine (restraints on alienation), as well as through statutory constructions that weaken patent law remedies and render the validity and enforceability patent rights less predictable.\n\nII. Patent Trial and Appeal Board Review: A Recent (and Constitutionally Questionable) Statutory Innovation that Has Undermined Patent Rights[REF]\n\nA. Patent Trial and Review Proceedings Are Unfair and Wasteful, and They Weaken Patents. In 2011, Congress enacted a major overhaul of the Patent Act, the Leahy\u2013Smith America Invents Act (AIA).[REF] A key feature of that overhaul was the creation of a novel type of \u201cinter partes review\u201d (IPR) process, run by the newly created Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).[REF] Under IPR, a third party may request the PTO to have administrative judges (PTO employees) re-examine the claims in an already issued patent and to cancel any claims that they find to be unpatentable in light of prior art. IPR responded to a stated concern that has been controversial from the start\u2014the subject of complaints that it is \u201crigged\u201d to strike down patent rights. As one noted commentator put it:\n\nWhile it is a laudable goal to make it easier to challenge obviously absurd patent claims, the way that post grant procedures were created does little other than ensure that any patent owner with a commercially valuable patent will face endless challenges. The patent system is supposed to encourage commercially relevant innovations, not to turn patents covering ubiquitous innovations into\u2026an illusory promise. After all, ubiquitous innovations become ubiquitous because they are so valuable.[REF]\n\nMore colorfully, Randall Rader, former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the federal patents appeal court), compared the PTAB to a \u201cdeath squad, kind of killing property rights.\u201d[REF] Perhaps the most notable element of PTAB review that puts at risk issued patents is that unpatentability for existing patent claims may be proved by a mere \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d rather than the much more exacting (and favorable to patent holders) standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d which applies in federal district court.\n\nIndeed, there is strong evidence that PTAB review has significantly weakened patent rights. The PTO\u2019s own statistics covering nearly five years of PTAB decisions (from September 16, 2012, to May 31, 2017)[REF] reveal that 65 percent (nearly two-thirds) of patents reviewed by PTAB had all of their claims invalidated; 17 percent of patents reviewed had some of their claims invalidated; and only 18 percent of patents reviewed had none of their claims invalidated. In short, over four-fifths of all patents (82 percent, or 65 percent plus 17 percent) had at least some of their claims declared invalid by PTAB\u2014very shortly after those patents had been reviewed and deemed valid by other PTO patent experts, the patent examiner corps.\n\nPatent experts (including leading judges, scholars, practitioners, and former PTO heads) have pointed out that PTAB\u2019s record of overturning the vast bulk of patents presented for review is far out of line with historic rates of patent reversals by the courts, and that this indicates that the PTAB process is seriously defective.[REF] Differences in procedures and standards between PTAB and federal district courts have been geared to make it far harder to defend patents in administrative inter parties reviews. Moreover, PTAB reviews have proceeded simultaneously with federal court judicial proceedings (leading to costly waste and duplication), and the PTAB has often invalidated thoroughly vetted patents that the federal courts have upheld.[REF] In addition, \u201c[w]hile close to a third of patent holders subjected to PTAB settle, these settlements are made under the PTAB storm clouds of extremely high invalidation rates and are settled under terms unfavorable to the patent holder.\u201d[REF] Summing up the problem, the lawyer who for many years represented the PTO in federal court appeals, former PTO Solicitor and law professor John Whealan, recently concluded that \u201c[t]he [PTAB review] system is not fair\u2026. The PTO doesn\u2019t presume what it does is right.\u201d[REF] Proposed reforms to improve the fairness of PTAB proceedings have included suggested rules changes to eliminate anti-patent holder bias and to restore the background presumption that a patent is valid (which is applied in the federal courts).[REF]\n\nThe PTAB\u2019s weakening of patent rights seriously threatens American innovation, which is key to future American economic growth and prosperity. What is worse, it also poses a potential threat to U.S. national security as well. Three leading American high-tech patent holders and entrepreneurs, citing recent research, have put it starkly:\n\nU.S. Patent grants fell significantly from 2014 to 2015 while China\u2019s filings skyrocketed. \u201cChina\u2019s patent office received by far the most filings, clocking nearly one million of them outstripping the combined total of patents filed in runner-up countries the United States and Japan.\u201d U.S. share of global venture capital has fallen dramatically. China increased its venture capital investment by 223%. This dramatic swing in venture capital, patent filings, and startups from the U.S. to China maps its time line directly to the creation of the PTAB, which also coincides with China\u2019s efforts to establish an innovator friendly patent system. China has seen the opportunity\u2026[created by] America\u2019s patent system becoming a hostile [one] for inventors, startups and venture capital, and is seizing the moment. The PTAB is truly a crisis that is driving venture capital, startups and job creation to China. If the PTAB is allowed to remain the death squad that it currently is, we will be buying our next generation of high tech software and hardware critical to our infrastructure and military from China. We [are] teetering on the doorstep of a national security disaster.[REF]\n\nB. The PTAB System Poses Grave Constitutional Problems. In addition to being unfair and harmful to patent rights, the PTAB process raises serious constitutional questions.\n\nFirst, there is a strong argument that enabling the PTAB to extinguish patents violates the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a civil jury trial in federal lawsuits \u201cat common law\u201d where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars.[REF] The Supreme Court has held that the Seventh Amendment\u2019s protections apply to the types of cases that existed under the English common law when the amendment was adopted,[REF] and lawsuits dealing with the infringement or extinguishment of patent rights were so treated in 18th-century England.[REF]\n\nSecond, the PTAB system undermines the constitutionally mandated separation of powers. Article III of the U.S. Constitution vests the federal judicial power in the U.S. Supreme Court and in inferior federal courts established by Congress. The Supreme Court \u201chas long recognized that in general, Congress may not \u2018withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law.\u2019\u201d[REF] By authorizing PTAB administrative law judges\u2014who are not Article II judges[REF]\u2014to review and extinguish patent-based property rights, Congress has ignored this command and substituted Executive Branch for Judicial Branch resolution of common-law legal disputes. Indeed, the Supreme Court has explicitly stated that \u201cthe only authority competent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United States, and not in the department which issued the patent.\u201d[REF]\n\nIn June 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court \u201cteed up\u201d these constitutional questions when it agreed to review the Oil States Energy case, raising the question of whether inter partes PTAB review \u201cviolates the Constitution by extinguishing private property rights through a non-Article III forum without a jury.\u201d[REF] It is far from clear, however, that the Supreme Court will hold that PTAB review is unconstitutional. As a panel of patent law experts recently noted (and as discussed previously, above), Supreme Court decisions have tended to weaken patent rights in recent years, and the Court has not raised doubts about the PTAB\u2019s constitutionality in recent decisions involving other aspects of PTAB inter partes reviews.[REF]\n\nC. Summary: The PTAB System Should Be Eliminated or at Least Significantly Overhauled. Given the unfairness and harm to patent rights stemming from PTAB review, and the real possibility that the Supreme Court may uphold the PTAB despite its constitutional infirmities, Congress may wish to act. The best congressional action would be repeal of the statutory provisions that authorize the PTAB. If, however, full statutory repeal is not feasible, amendments to rein in and seriously reform the PTAB process would be advisable. (A legislative proposal that would do just that is briefly discussed in Section V of this memorandum.)\n\nIII. Recent Changes in Antitrust Enforcement Policy Have Further Weakened U.S. Patents\n\nOver the past century, U.S. patent rights have been subjected to scrutiny under the U.S. antitrust laws. Although they are not mentioned in the Constitution, antitrust laws have long been seen as holding a special status in the federal statutory hierarchy. The U.S. Supreme Court, for example, famously stated that \u201c[a]ntitrust laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.\u201d[REF] Since the late 1970s, mainstream American antitrust analysis (as reflected in U.S. Supreme Court decisions, enforcement policies, and scholarship) has sought to advance \u201ceconomic efficiency\u201d and consumer welfare.[REF] The focus has been on challenging only those business actions that harm the competitive process. Efficient business practices that harm individual competitors\u2014but not the competitive process\u2014have not been challenged. Indeed, efficient business practices by a monopolist that allows it to maximize its profits are perfectly permissible, as the Supreme Court emphasized in its unanimous landmark 2004 Verizon v. Trinko decision:\n\nThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system. The opportunity to charge monopoly prices\u2014at least for a short period\u2014is what attracts \u201cbusiness acumen\u201d in the first place; it induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth. To safeguard the incentive to innovate, the possession of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive conduct.[REF]\n\nWhile the antitrust treatment of patents has varied over the past century, from the early 1980s to roughly 2010, American antitrust law generally gave great leeway to patent holders to maximize the value of their patents through unilateral action, in particular, through restrictions placed on a patent license.[REF] The consensus view of patent licensing was embodied in 1995 Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property,[REF] issued by the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the two federal antitrust agencies. The Guidelines explained: (1) For the purpose of antitrust analysis, the DOJ and FTC regard a patent as being essentially comparable to any other form of property; (2) The DOJ and FTC do not presume that a patent creates market power in the antitrust context; and (3) The DOJ and FTC recognize that patent licensing allows firms to combine complementary factors of production and is generally pro-competitive.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Obama Administration antitrust enforcers ushered in a period of new uncertainty regarding the U.S. antitrust treatment of unilateral patent licensing.[REF] This was particularly the case with respect to the licensing of \u201cstandard essential\u201d patents (SEPs)\u2014patents that cover technologies incorporated into important technical standards widely used by competitors in an industry, such as the high-tech smartphone sector. The antitrust-enforcement concern raised was that the need for manufacturers to use key standardized technologies gave additional unwarranted \u201cmarket power\u201d to the holders of SEPs, which should be curtailed through antitrust limits on SEP licensing terms. In short, patent owners\u2019 efforts to maximize the returns on their own patents could be thwarted by antitrust enforcers, a result in tension with the broad teaching of Trinko.\n\nConsistent with this theme, among other actions:\n\nThe FTC entered into settlements with firms that capped the price of their SEP licenses at very low rates (and, worse, filed a questionable lawsuit against Qualcomm essentially based on \u201coverly high\u201d licensing rates mere days before the end of the Obama Administration); [REF]\n\nThe DOJ commented favorably on proposed standard-setting rules designed to sharply constrain SEP holders\u2019 licensing flexibility; and\n\nAntitrust officials made public statements suggesting possible antitrust investigations of SEP licensing.\n\nTaken together, by reducing potential returns to patent licensing, these actions undermined the incentives of patent owners\u2014and, in particular, SEP holders\u2014to invest in technologies related to standards to the detriment of innovation. Competition among patent holders also suffered, to the extent reduced investment in technologies lessened rivalrous efforts to achieve product quality breakthroughs.\n\nRegrettably, the recent U.S. antitrust policy changes regarding patents helped foster a more aggressive approach to patent-antitrust suits by foreign authorities, further exacerbating the harm suffered by U.S. patent holders:\n\nUS antitrust policy changes do not operate in a vacuum. Major foreign competition enforcers such as China and Korea, are by nature more interventionist than US agencies, and recently they have undertaken a variety of intrusive investigations and enforcement measures directed at patents. The continuing apparent denigration of patent rights by US antitrust authorities can only encourage them to continue along this path\u2014a result that may further undermine innovation and welfare. Chinese officials\u2019 public references (albeit less than fully accurate) to FTC settlements restricting SEPs are but one example of this sad phenomenon.[REF]\n\nMost recently, in a similar vein, a March 2017 experts\u2019 report on foreign antitrust commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that foreign governments\u2019 inappropriate orders requiring the worldwide lowering of patent license rates by U.S. patent-owning defendants threatens \u201cto reduce incentives for innovation\u2026around the world.\u201d[REF] The report stressed that \u201c[g]iven the seriousness of the economic consequences of foreign disrespect for U.S. [patent]\u2026rights, the Trump Administration may wish to take a strong stance against specific foreign antitrust abuses that target U.S. patents in a manner inconsistent with core competition principles by engaging in international consultations and by considering possible sanctions if all else fails.\u201d[REF]\n\nMore broadly, the recent unfortunate turn in patent\u2013antitrust policy manifested a general Obama Administration regulatory attitude that was less favorable to patents,[REF] seemingly \u201creflect[ing] a general administrative disdain for strong property rights and a belief in the superior ability of enlightened technocrats to micromanage the economy.\u201d[REF] The Trump Administration should reverse this regrettable trend. It should make it clear in word and deed that it will not challenge legitimate efforts by patent owners to achieve maximum profits on their patent rights through licensing\u2014and will work with foreign governments to reverse unwarranted antitrust attacks on such legitimate unilateral patent licensing practices.\n\nIV. Sound Economics Supports Strengthening the U.S. Patent System\n\nSound economics supports the case for strengthening, not weakening, the patent system. Before turning to this research, however, a brief review and debunking of flawed criticisms of the American patent system is in order.\n\nA. Misplaced Critiques of the Patent System Are Flawed and Do Not Justify Further Legislative Weakening of Patent Rights. The recent weakening of the U.S. patent system, through judicial decisions, statutory change (establishment of the PTAB), and administrative actions, finds support in some critiques of the patent system that arose around a decade ago. A widely cited article asserting that patent rights are by their nature \u201chighly uncertain\u201d and generate excessive litigation[REF] lent fuel to support for patent-related \u201clitigation reform\u201d and efforts to constrain patent rights through legislation. Efforts to \u201cmodernize\u201d the American patent system were embodied in the America Invents Act of 2011, and subsequent congressional bills were introduced in order to reduce the burden imposed by unwarranted patent infringement lawsuits.[REF] Supporters of new legislation often cited the allegedly excessive costs due to \u201cbad quality\u201d patents issued by patent examiners and unjustified lawsuits by \u201cpatent trolls\u201d (also called \u201cpatent assertion entities\u201d)\u2014bad-actor firms that make no products and buy up questionable patents merely for the purpose of profiting from abusive lawsuits against productive businesses.\n\nWith regard to alleged problems in \u201cpatent quality,\u201d the PTO in recent years has undertaken a comprehensive initiative aimed at avoiding the issuance of patents that do not meet statutory standards for patentability. It \u201cpromotes and supports the continuous improvement of patent products, processes and services through collaboration with internal and external stakeholders of the intellectual property community.\u201d[REF] Thus, although perfection in patent examination will never be achieved\u2014that would be impossible\u2014the patent quality problem is being dealt with in a reasonable fashion.\n\nWith respect to \u201cwasteful lawsuits\u201d and \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d additional legislation designed to further curb patent litigation through procedural changes has not been enacted. This is a good thing. As Heritage Foundation scholars have pointed out, the extent to which wasteful lawsuits actually have spawned a serious patent-litigation problem is very much in question, particularly since \u201cthe volume of patent lawsuits has remained remarkably stable over the years.\u201d[REF] Furthermore, there are perfectly legitimate reasons (such as a sole focus on inventing or pure research) why a party may wish to sell its patents to third parties, rather than enforce them directly. Relatedly, patent aggregators often facilitate an efficient division of labor, allowing many inventors to specialize in what they do best\u2014inventing.[REF]\n\nAlthough there are some cases of unwarranted patent litigation, existing judicial tools to deal with abusive lawsuits in general are the best solution: \u201cJudges should be empowered and encouraged to employ sanctions and bond requirements to deter abusive litigants of all types, not based on whether they are plaintiffs or defendants or whether they are patent assertion entities or \u2018active users\u2019 of a patent.\u201d[REF] In short, \u201c[p]recipitous, unreflective action on legislation is unwarranted, and caution should be the byword.\u201d[REF]\n\nAdditional critiques directed at the current American patent system have been raised to further justify curbs on patent rights. These include claims that the system is rife with (1) multi-patent \u201cpatent thickets,\u201d which are described as an overlapping set of patent rights that cover innovative products and which raise transaction and litigation costs; (2) \u201cpatent stacking\u201d whereby multiple patents covering a single product burden that product\u2019s manufacturer with having to pay \u201cexcessive\u201d royalty fees; and (3) hold-ups, whereby holders of patents that cover a particular standard demand \u201cexcessive\u201d royalties from manufacturers, backed by the threat of lawsuits. These theoretical assertions, however, lack empirical support, and have been debunked by an academic study (scheduled for publication later this year) which finds that \u201cthe paucity of evidence for thicket, holdup and stacking effects recommend[s] against policy actions that have weakened patent protections in technology markets.\u201d[REF] That study also finds that the \u201cde-propertization\u201d of patent rights stemming from the limitation on injunctions, imposed by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s eBAY decision, and by judicial reductions in monetary awards for patent infringement, have discouraged innovation.[REF]\n\nB. Economic Analysis Lends Robust Support to Strong Patent Rights. At the same time that critics of \u201cbad\u201d patents and \u201cabusive\u201d patent lawsuits were making arguments that had the perhaps unintended effect of weakening American patent rights, an impressive amount of economic analysis was published that supported the case for very strong patent rights, which strongly suggests that, if anything, Congress should direct its attention away from further curbing patents and toward undoing the recent erosion of U.S. patent rights. U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner (and current Acting Chairwoman) Maureen Ohlhausen has eloquently summarized the rapidly expanding empirical literature indicating that robust patent rights stimulate research and development and economic growth.[REF] Ohlhausen explains that published economic research, covering many countries and extended time periods, unambiguously indicates that intellectual property rights are an incentive that spur innovation. In so doing, she highlights studies showing:\n\nCountries that provide stronger patent protection tend to have larger proportions of their gross national products devoted to research and development (the seed corn for economic growth). Patents affect economic growth by stimulating the accumulation of factor inputs such as research and development capital and physical capital. Patents are correlated with economic growth across and within the same country over time. Research and development spending since 1953 is strongly associated with patenting. U.S. data between 1980 and 2010 show patenting to be associated with higher metropolitan area productivity, indicating that patents cause economic growth. Large-scale manufacturers have invested far more aggressively in patents during the period associated with strong U.S. patent rights, even controlling for other known determinants of patenting.\n\nThese empirical findings are fully in line with economic theory regarding strong patents and economic progress.[REF] Specifically, as law and economics analysis explains:\n\nThe patent system not only creates incentives for individuals by providing them a reward for invention, it also allows firms to signal to capital markets their capabilities. The patent system lowers transaction costs by establishing a title registration system for certain information-based assets. The patent system transforms the market for inventions into a market for innovative control by providing financing and spurring innovation. The patent system creates a platform for the commercialization of innovations\u2014a theory developed in detail by professor and former U.S. International Trade Commissioner F. Scott Kieff.\n\nThe \u201ccommercialization explanation\u201d for patent-induced innovation merits particular note:\n\n[The commercialization approach] is [c]entered on the relationships among private parties\u2026. [T]his approach targets a broad, diverse set of market actors in general; and it does so indirectly. This broad set of indirectly targeted actors encompasses the creator or inventor of the underlying [patent] asset as well as all those complementary users of a creation or an invention who can help bring it to market, such as investors (including venture capitalists), entrepreneurs, managers, marketers, developers, laborers, and owners of other key assets, tangible and intangible, including other creations or inventions\u2026. This commercialization approach sees property rights in [patents] serving a role akin to beacons in the dark, drawing to themselves all of those potential complementary users of the [patent]-protected-asset to interact with the [patent] owner and each other. This helps them each explore through the bargaining process the possibility of striking contracts with each other.[REF]\n\nIn sum, legal and economic theory, buttressed by multiple empirical studies, demonstrates that strong patent systems, which encourage research and development and investment, spur innovation and support robust economic growth. Thus, it is most unfortunate that recent legal developments have tended to undermine, rather than bolster, the American patent system.\n\nV. Legal Policy Reforms Needed to Strengthen the American Patent System and Promote Innovation\n\nThe preceding discussion makes it clear that reforms are needed to strengthen the American patent system and promote innovation. What specific legislative and other reforms are needed?\n\nThe STRONGER Patent Act of 2017. A bipartisan congressional reform package designed to further safeguard patent rights in administrative reviews and litigation, the STRONGER Patent Act of 2017 (STRONGER Act), was introduced on June 21, 2017, by Senator Christopher Coons and by Senator Tom Cotton (R\u2013AR).[REF]\n\nThe one-page descriptive sheet released in tandem with the STRONGER Act\u2019s introduction briefly makes the case for legislation:\n\n\u201cA number of changes over the past decade have weakened the U.S. patent system, from Supreme Court decisions to the unintended consequences of new post-grant administrative proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThe result is that the U.S. patent system is now ranked tenth worldwide by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Until this year, it was always ranked first.\n\nThese changes risk undermining investor confidence in technology-intensive small businesses, ceding the U.S.\u2019s historic edge in innovation to Europe or China.\n\nThe impact of undermining the patent system will be significant\u2014patent-intensive industries create high-paying jobs that have a wage premium of 74 percent, and the U.S. currently has a trade surplus of about $85 billion due to the licensing of IP rights.\n\nStrong patents are also vital to technology-intensive startups. Research shows that if a startup receives a patent, its chance of securing venture capital increases over 50 percent, and it is likely to have better growth in employment and sales.\u201d [REF]\n\nThe STRONGER Act proposes \u201cbalanced reforms\u201d to solve the problem of a weakened American patent system.\n\nProtect American Inventors from Illegal Infringement. U.S. courts should treat a patent like any other property right, permitting preliminary injunctions to protect patent owners against infringement while cases are pending, and granting permanent relief to protect a patent owner from ongoing infringement after a court determines the patent to be valid and infringed. A presumption that patent owners are entitled to injunctive relief will also encourage infringers to negotiate fair licenses based on the free market, keeping cases out of court.\n\nU.S. courts should treat a patent like any other property right, permitting preliminary injunctions to protect patent owners against infringement while cases are pending, and granting permanent relief to protect a patent owner from ongoing infringement after a court determines the patent to be valid and infringed. A presumption that patent owners are entitled to injunctive relief will also encourage infringers to negotiate fair licenses based on the free market, keeping cases out of court. Ensure Fairness in Patent Office Administrative Challenges. Five years after the Leahy\u2013Smith America Invents Act created proceedings at the Patent Office to allow faster and cheaper challenges to patents, it has become clear that further changes are needed to limit repetitive and harassing challenges against patent owners and to ensure that the proceedings are fair to all parties, including solo inventors and small businesses.\n\nFive years after the Leahy\u2013Smith America Invents Act created proceedings at the Patent Office to allow faster and cheaper challenges to patents, it has become clear that further changes are needed to limit repetitive and harassing challenges against patent owners and to ensure that the proceedings are fair to all parties, including solo inventors and small businesses. Protect Small Businesses and Consumers from Abusive Patent-Demand Letters. Changes are needed to ensure that the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general have the tools they need to protect consumers and small businesses from bad-faith, abusive demand letters.\n\nChanges are needed to ensure that the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general have the tools they need to protect consumers and small businesses from bad-faith, abusive demand letters. Fully Fund the USPTO to Ensure Timely, High-Quality Patents. Inventors\u2019 patent application fees should remain at the USPTO. It is not fair to tax inventors for government spending. Adequate, dependable funding is critical for timely, higher-quality patents.\u201d [REF]\n\nA more comprehensive section-by-section analysis of the STRONGER Patents Act fills in more details.[REF] In particular, this analysis demonstrates that the STRONGER Act seeks to conform PTAB rules with well settled federal district court rules that are more respectful of patent rights. Thus, for example, the STRONGER Act requires the PTAB to apply federal court rules regarding patent claims construction and the burden of proof (the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard for overturning a patent claim).\n\nOther STRONGER Act provisions to undo PTAB-related abuses include immediate appeal to the federal courts of certain PTAB holdings, elimination of repetitive PTAB challenges, and the halting of PTAB proceedings when patent validity is being reviewed in a federal court. Patent re-examination proceedings by the PTO are harmonized with PTAB reviews to provide clear guidelines for the treatment of parallel proceedings. The AIA is clarified to ensure that PTO adjudicators who decide whether to permit a post-grant proceeding are distinct from the PTAB judges who will decide the outcome of a proceeding. The presumption that a patent holder is entitled to injunctive relief\u2014and does not have to settle for royalty payments\u2014is designed explicitly to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s eBay decision, which, as discussed above, has undermined patent rights. The STRONGER Act also provides a helpful nod toward those who are concerned that abusive demand letters by patent trolls impose unjustified costs on smaller businesses.\n\nThe STRONGER Patents Act represents an excellent initial step in the effort to achieve firmer legislative protection for patent rights. The Act\u2019s focus on restoring the general right to obtain injunctions and equalizing the treatment of patent owners before the PTAB and federal courts would tend to enhance patent values by making patent infringement less profitable and by increasing the likelihood that meritorious patents would be upheld. The proposed targeting of abusive \u201cdemand letters\u201d is a sensible measure that should not undermine legitimate patent rights, nor interfere with the efficient functioning of legitimate patent aggregators.[REF] Further legislative work to refine the proposals found in the STRONGER Act would be most worthwhile. In particular, Congress may wish to propose statutorily eliminating the PTAB system in its entirety, given the grave constitutional problems it raises.[REF]\n\nA. Legislative Reforms Aimed at Enhancing Patent Eligibility. Additional legislative reforms, however, would also be beneficial. Specifically, the problems raised by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s weakening of patent eligibility standards posed by the creation of case law that has narrowed Section 101 of the Patent Act[REF] urgently needs to be addressed. Amendments to clarify patent eligibility have been proposed by two leading trade associations that support robust intellectual property protection, the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO), and the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA).\n\nThe IPO\u2019s proposal,[REF] released in February 2017, confronts the problem of Supreme Court decisions \u201cthat have dramatically narrowed the scope of patent protection for life sciences and software technology by significantly expanding the judicially-created exceptions to patent eligible subject matter.\u201d[REF] It puts forth Section 101 amendments that are designed to \u201creverse recent Supreme Court rulings and restore the scope of subject matter eligibility to that intended by Congress in the passage of the Patent Act of 1952,\u201d \u201cdefine subject matter eligibility more clearly and in a technology-neutral manner,\u201d \u201crequire an evaluation of subject matter eligibility for the invention as a whole,\u201d and \u201csimplify the subject matter eligibility analysis for the Patent Office, courts, patent applicants, patentees, and the public by prohibiting consideration of \u2018inventiveness\u2019 and patentability issues\u201d[REF] that are dealt with in other parts of the Patent Act.\n\nThe AIPLA\u2019s proposal[REF] also is designed to rewrite Section 101 in a manner that overrides recent Supreme Court\u2013made exceptions to patentability and narrows the reach of that section. It is generally similar but not identical to the IPO proposal. It would provide for broad patent eligibility of a claimed invention, the only two exceptions being when a \u201c\u2018claimed invention as a whole exists in nature independently of and prior to any human activity, or can be performed solely in the human mind.\u2019 The application of these [two] exceptions should be predictable because the application will not involve the exercise of judgment regarding, for example, the extent of preclusion or the incremental value of the invention.\u201d[REF] Other constraints on whether a patent merits being awarded, such as utility, novelty, non-obviousness, and enablement, would be dealt with under the other Sections of the Patent Act applied by patent examiners and not \u201cpulled into\u201d Section 101 as additional constraints on eligible subject matter. In sum:\n\nAIPLA\u2019s proposal expressly ends the common-law development of the so-called judicial exceptions to patent eligibility. It creates two statutory exceptions to patent eligibility and eliminates the ability of the Supreme Court to develop further exceptions as a matter of its common-law interpretation of the patent statute\u2026. AIPLA\u2019s Legislative Proposal does not, in other words, put in place a wholly backward-looking test for patent eligibility that cannot be predictably applied to new patent claims. As a result, AIPLA\u2019s proposal should not be subject to tinkering in the future by the USPTO or courts. The exceptions in AIPLA\u2019s Legislative Proposal will be able to be used to determine the eligibility of future technologies.[REF]\n\nThe IPO and AIPLA proposals are serious efforts to simplify patent eligibility in a manner that clears away confusing judicially made exceptions, freeing basic eligibility determinations from being confusingly comingled with other statutory requirements that must be met before a patent is issued. These initiatives, and others like them, point the way toward legislation that could make it significantly easier for valuable innovations in the life sciences and computer sciences to obtain patents\u2014providing a strong incentive for American inventors and thus a boon to the American economy.\n\nB. Other Targeted Legislation. While the legislative proposals highlighted above are of paramount importance, Congress also should weigh targeted measures aimed at two Supreme Court decisions that undermine the value of certain patents.\n\nTargeted legislation should be considered to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2017 Lexmark decision regarding patent exhaustion[REF] in order to enhance the ability of patent holders to enter into efficient contracts and thereby raise the value of their patents. Legislative language could, for example, provide that patent owners may impose and enforce under patent law contractual restrictions on the resale of items embodying patented technology.\n\nTargeted legislation should also be considered to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 Teleflex decision,[REF] which generated additional uncertainty regarding the \u201cobviousness\u201d of an invention and thereby created a cloud surrounding the status of many patents, reducing their marketability and value. Congress may wish, for example, to establish a clearer, more specific benchmark for obviousness, such as the \u201cteaching, suggestion, and motivation\u201d test (the accepted standard prior to Teleflex). Under this test a patent is struck down for obviousness only when it is shown that pre-patent publicly available information known to individuals \u201cskilled in the art\u201d would have apprised those technical experts of the value of combining the \u201cinventive steps\u201d that lie at the heart of a patent claim.[REF] This test avoids the \u201chindsight bias\u201d implicit in Teleflex, which injected confusion into obviousness determinations by creating unfocused and subjective after-the-fact inquiries into whether inventions yielded \u201cpredictable results.\u201d\n\nC. Non-Legislative Initiatives. While patent-related legislative reform is vital, its fate and timing are uncertain. While the Trump Administration should strongly endorse legislative initiatives along the lines summarized above, it cannot merely wait for legislative passage. It also can and should take executive actions now to strengthen the patent system.\n\nFirst, the President should only appoint officials to the PTO and other federal agencies that interact with the patent system who are committed to robust protection of patent rights.\n\nSecond, the President should issue memoranda to federal agencies (and, when appropriate, Executive Orders) making the enhanced protection of patent rights a top Administration priority, which will be reflected in the Administration\u2019s formal and informal regulatory actions, policy pronouncements, litigation policy, and international negotiations. Relatedly, the Director of the PTO should play a high-profile role in ensuring that a \u201cpro-patent\u201d orientation prevails at the PTO and is communicated to all patent examiners.\n\nThird, the President should convene a White House\u2013led interagency working group on patents, chaired by the Director of the PTO and including senior representatives from all federal agencies. The working group should be directed to study laws, regulations, and policies that affect patent rights, and recommend reforms as appropriate. The working group should also be tasked with developing a strategy for patent legislative reform along the lines discussed in this memorandum.[REF] Once an appropriate legislative package is developed, the Administration should work diligently to secure its passage.\n\nFourth, the President should direct the DOJ, to the fullest extent possible, to advocate in favor of strong patent rights in conducting litigation involving the United States as a party and in filing \u201cfriend of the court\u201d briefs in other cases involving questions of patent law interpretation. In particular, the DOJ should file a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the Oil States Energy case, taking the position that PTAB review is unconstitutional.[REF]\n\nFifth, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission should take action to reverse the prior Administration\u2019s policies regarding the application of the antitrust laws to patent rights. In particular, they should amend federal antitrust guidelines to clarify that unilateral efforts (not involving anticompetitive agreements with owners of competing technologies) by a patent holder to maximize the value of its patent rights\u2014and, in particular, through patent licensing restrictions\u2014should not give rise to antitrust liability. They should also advance this principle in court filings and in speeches here and abroad. In particular, DOJ and FTC officials should work hard to promote international support for this principle. They should advance it in consultations with foreign agencies and in the development of new and amended antitrust enforcement chapters (also called \u201ccompetition chapters\u201d) in international trade agreements.\n\nSixth, subject to overall White House guidance, the DOJ, the FTC, and the U.S. government economic agencies (including in particular the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. Commerce Department, the U.S. Treasury Department, and other agencies as appropriate) should work cooperatively to oppose foreign regulatory restrictions or enforcement actions that undermine American patent rights\u2014including unwarranted foreign antitrust prosecutions or remedies.[REF] The White House should ensure that all appropriate responses, including possible sanctions, are adequately weighed when inappropriate foreign actions threaten to impose substantial harm on American commerce.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nThe constitutionally based U.S. patent system has long been a driver of American innovation and economic growth, but it is faltering. An unfortunate confluence of Supreme Court decisions, legislative amendments, and Administration policy changes have combined to significantly weaken patent rights and displace the United States as an international leader in patent protection. This is not just a problem for patent owners. If bold action is not taken to address the recent decline in the effectiveness of U.S. patent protection, American innovation will decline and the American economy will suffer\u2014to the detriment of American workers, businesses, and innovators.\n\nSpecific actions can and should be taken to reinvigorate the U.S. patent system.\n\nLegislation should eliminate or sharply rein in the PTAB, which has been used to eliminate an unjustifiably large proportion of recently enacted patents without adequate judicial oversight.\n\nLegislation should restore the presumption that a patent holder is entitled to injunctive relief, which absolutely bars infringers from illegally using his or her property.\n\nLegislation should overturn judicial holdings that have narrowed the scope of patentable subject matter, preventing key meritorious innovations from getting patent protection.\n\nLegislation should overturn other judicial holdings that have limited patent owners\u2019 contractual flexibility and have generated inappropriate uncertainty as to whether inventions will be adjudged \u201cobvious\u201d and therefore unpatentable.\n\nThe President should take actions to appoint \u201cpro-patent\u201d officials and establish strong \u201cpro-patent\u201d policies throughout his Administration.\n\nU.S. antitrust enforcers should: (1) reject the last Administration\u2019s antitrust policies that undermined the unilateral exercise of patent rights; and (2) restore the understanding that strong patents and antitrust are fully compatible.\n\nThe Trump Administration should vigorously oppose foreign actions aimed at undermining American patent rights, and take affirmative steps on the global stage to promote greater respect and protection for patents.\n\nNo single recommendation is a silver-bullet solution to the problems that have plagued the American patent system. Taken together, however, these proposals provide a blueprint for Administration and congressional action on multiple fronts designed to significantly strengthen American patent rights and restore the United States patent system to a position of world leadership. Successful implementation of the blueprint would strike a blow for the protection of private property rights and redound to the benefit of all Americans.\n\n\u2014Alden F. Abbott is Deputy Director of, and John, Barbara, and Victoria Rumpel Senior Legal Fellow in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, of the Institute for Constitutional Government, at The Heritage Foundation.", "In June 2013, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed the Protection of Texas Children Act (BH 1009) into law, authorizing schools to train certain employees as \u201cschool marshals\u201d and carry concealed weapons on campus. After an apparent challenge to the bill by Democrat State Representative Joe Pickett (D-El Paso) in an AG Opinion Request, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott re-affirmed the authority of the law and clarified issues raised by Pickett.\n\nThe bill\u2019s author, State Rep. Jason Villalba (R-Dallas) said, \u201cWe\u2019ve created a new class of law enforcement officers here in Texas to protect our kids in a moment of crisis,\u201d after the bill\u2019s passage last year. The bill was created in response to the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nRep. Pickett, who currently serves as Chairman of the House Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee after being appointed in the 2013 session by Speaker Joe Straus, sent a seven-page request for an Attorney General Opinion dated October 21st, 2013 (posted below), that seemed to challenge the legality of the bill because of conflicts with already existing concealed handgun carry laws. In a copy of the request obtained by Breitbart Texas, Picket raises the following questions:\n\nDoes a school district\u2019s written authorization allowing either an employee or trustee who has a CHL to carry and use a concealed handgun on school property pursuant to Penal Code \u00a746.03(a)(l) (Guardian Plan) override the prohibition against a concealed handgun license holder from carrying a handgun at \u201cany meeting of a governmental entity\u201d under Penal Code \u00a746.035(c)? Does a school district\u2019s written authorization allowing either an employee or trustee who has a CHL to carry and use a concealed handgun on school property pursuant to Penal Code \u00a746.03(a)(l) (Guardian Plan) override the prohibition against a concealed handgun license holder from carrying a handgun \u201con the premises where a high school, \u2026 sporting event or interscholastic event is taking place\u201d on school property under Penal Code \u00a746.035(b)(2)? \u00b7 Would serving as a Guardian under a school district\u2019s Guardian Plan fall within the scope of official duties of a school board trustee under Texas Education Code \u00a7 11.15ll(b)(l5)? If the answer to question nos. 1 and/or 2 above is \u201cNo,\u201d may a school district simultaneously appoint one employee to serve as a School Marshal under HB 1009 (to ensure an armed presence at school board meetings and sporting events), and appoint another person to serve as a Guardian under a Guardian Plan (to allow flexibility in its armed presence in other locations)?\n\nGeneral Abbott responded to Pickett\u2019s request in the AG Opinion (GA-1051), a copy of which is also posted below, \u201cto answer your first two questions, Penal Code section 46.035, subsections (b) and (c) are not violated when a person is lawfully carrying a handgun pursuant to a school board\u2019s written regulations and authorization because such a person is not carrying the weapon \u201cunder the authority of Subchapter H, Chapter 411, Government Code.\u201d\n\nAs to the third question, Abbott states that a categorical answer is difficult to provide because of varying jurisdictional issues. However, Abbott concluded, \u201cA person acting according to a school board\u2019s written regulations and authorization would likely be acting within the scope of official duties.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, on the fourth question, Abbott responds, \u201cNo provision in House Bill 1009 conflicts with or is in any way inconsistent with subsection 46.03(a)(l) of the Penal Code. Accordingly, a school board may appoint one person to serve as a school marshal under section 37.0811 of the Education Code and authorize another person to serve under the district\u2019s regulations and authorization under subsection 46.03(a)(l) of the Penal Code.\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing Gen. Abbott\u2019s Opinion, State Representative Allen Fletcher (R-Cypress), who serves as Vice-Chairman of the House Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee, responded to an inquiry from Breitbart Texas stating, \u201cAs a retired police officer, I understand that law enforcement officers cannot be everywhere and that this law was designed to provide the extra security needed to protect our children.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeneral Abbott\u2019s Opinion answers Mr. Pickett\u2019s questions that were already clear in the law,\u201d Fletcher continued, \u201cand made it clear that schools may freely move forward with their efforts to provide the needed additional security to protect our most precious assets, our children.\u201d\n\nFletcher was instrumental in passing the Campus Concealed Carry Bill in the last session which passed out of the House but died in the Senate. Fletcher has pledged to bring that issue back next session and fight for its passage.\n\nHB 1009 was passed in the Texas House by a vote of 123-22 and in the Senate by a vote of 27-4. Both Representatives Pickett and Fletcher voted yea on the measure. It was signed into law by Gov.

But two very different stories.\n\nRegina de Lima and Tainara Lourenco became pregnant at a scary moment \u2013 the dawn of an extraordinary Zika outbreak, as authorities came to suspect that the virus was causing an alarming spike in a rare birth defect called microcephaly. Both have reason to fear for the health of their unborn offspring.\n\nBut that is where the similarities end.\n\nLima is well-off, and took advantage of the options of affluence.\n\nLourenco lives in a slum. She has no options, except to hope for the best.\n\n\u2014\n\nWhen Lima learned she was pregnant, her initial, vertiginous rush of happiness was almost immediately smothered by dread.\n\nLima and her husband had been trying to start a family but decided to put the project on hold in late November, after the Brazilian government announced a possible link between mosquito-borne Zika and microcephaly, in which infants are born with unusually small heads and can sometimes suffer mental retardation or a host of serious health and developmental problems.\n\nThe connection between Zika and microcephaly is not yet understood, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is strong evidence of a link. And with more than 3,700 confirmed or suspected cases of microcephaly registered here since October \u2013 compared with fewer than 150 cases in all of 2014 \u2013 the Brazilian government took the drastic step of urging would-be parents to put off pregnancies.\n\nBut for Lima, an audiovisual producer from Rio de Janeiro, it was too late. She was already pregnant, and her first trimester \u2013 thought to be when the fetus is most susceptible to Zika \u2013 would coincide with Rio\u2019s summer mosquito season.\n\n\u201cThe first weeks were terrifying,\u201d said Lima. \u201cI cried and cried.\u201d\n\nShe was haunted by fears she may have already had Zika without knowing it \u2013 the illness can cause a fever and red splotches on the skin, but is asymptomatic in most cases \u2013 and that her baby would develop microcephaly, which ultrasounds only pick up starting in the seventh month.\n\nSo Lima did what growing numbers of wealthy Brazilian women are doing: She requested an extended vacation from work, packed her bags and left for Europe. She plans to stay at least through the end of the dicey first trimester.\n\n\u201cI am in a sort of exile \u2013 I could be at home with my husband, seeing my own doctors, but instead I\u2019m here in Europe with a suitcase,\u201d Lima said in a telephone interview from London, quickly adding that she wasn\u2019t complaining. \u201cI am lucky to have options, to be able to make decisions. Most women in my situation don\u2019t have that luxury. They\u2019re completely at the mercy of fate.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nIndeed, although she\u2019s living on a shoestring \u2013 crashing with friends and moving weekly so as not to overstay her welcome \u2013 Lima\u2019s peace of mind comes with a price tag that would be unthinkable for the vast majority of women in this most socially stratified of countries.\n\nHer airline ticket alone cost several times the monthly minimum wage of just over $200, and with Brazil\u2019s currency at historic lows amid an economic recession, even everyday expenses in Europe have become exorbitant by Brazilian standards.\n\nUnemployed and five months pregnant, 21-year-old Lourenco lives in a slum at the epicenter of Brazil\u2019s tandem Zika and microcephaly outbreaks, the state of Pernambuco in Brazil\u2019s impoverished and underdeveloped northeast.\n\nHer shack is cobbled together from bits of wood and perches on stilts over a giant puddle of fetid water below. To eke out a living for herself and her 2-year-old daughter, Lourenco ventures into a nearby swamp to hunt for crustaceans she hawks for $2.50 a kilogram.\n\n\u201cI think I got Zika or some other disease not long ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can we do? Just hope that it doesn\u2019t affect the baby.\u201d\n\nZika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is well-adapted to humans, thrives in people\u2019s homes and can breed in even a bottle cap\u2019s-worth of stagnant water \u2013 not to mention the pools of rain water that lurk in just about every nook and cranny during the muggy summer rain season. While anyone can be bitten by Aedes, public health experts agree that the poor are more vulnerable because they often lack amenities that help diminish the risk, such as air conditioning and window screens.\n\nThe only precautionary measure Lourenco could possibly take, long-sleeve clothing, is unworkable in the unrelenting equatorial heat.\n\nLike many of the estimated 400,000 women currently pregnant in Brazil, she can\u2019t afford mosquito repellent. Microcephaly fears have sparked a run on repellents, emptying out the stock in many pharmacies in hard-hit areas; where it\u2019s still available \u2013 often fishing supply stores \u2013 it now often costs several times the normal price.\n\nThe government has pledged to start providing repellent to low-income women and promises to deploy some 220,000 members of the Armed Forces to help eliminate Aedes\u2019 breeding places as part of President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s declared war against the insect. But the measures are too little, too late for women whose worries about microcephaly have transformed their pregnancies into a period of unending anguish.\n\nIn the Central American nation of El Salvador, where authorities have urged women to put off pregnancy for two years, Guadalupe Urquilla is struggling to take fate into her own hands.\n\nShe\u2019s traded her dresses for long pants and closed shoes, scrubs out the family\u2019s concrete water tank every three days, and writes San Salvador city officials, demanding that they fumigate the debris-strewn public housing complex where she lives with her husband and 2-year-old daughter.\n\nUrquilla said her husband is believed to have had Zika last fall and her daughter had dengue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really scared,\u201d said Urquilla, who\u2019s in her 13th week of pregnancy. \u201cImagine my baby does not get Zika, but imagine how stressed out it will be when it comes out. The whole pregnancy we\u2019re stressed out about mosquitoes. \u2026 It\u2019s a huge paranoia.\u201d\n\nLourenco, though, is more fatalistic.\n\n\u201cIf you have to get sick you will get sick,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere.\u201d", "The annual Teen Choice Awards turned political Sunday night, partnering with the liberal-leaning Rock the Vote campaign to poll teens about their \u201cChoice President.\u201d The award show\u2019s hosts WWE superstar John Cena and actress Victoria Justice dressed in drag as presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nComedian and former Key & Peele star Keegan-Michael Key took the stage and launched into his best President Obama impersonation before introducing Cena and Justice as Clinton and Trump.\n\n\u201cThis year, we are holding the first ever Teen Choice presidential election.

The Teen Choice Awards took to Twitter and announced Hillary Clinton as the winner.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson", "The Obama Administration\u2019s disastrous legacy in Syria is one of the most urgent issues confronting the Trump Administration. The former Administration\u2019s complacent approach to the Syrian conflict\u2014toothless diplomacy based on wishful thinking and mistaken acquiescence to Moscow\u2019s diplomatic schemes\u2014has yielded a humanitarian catastrophe: a strengthened Assad regime, an emboldened Russia that has enhanced its limited geostrategic foothold in the Middle East, an expanding Iranian military intervention, and a fertile environment for the growth of Islamist extremism.\n\nThe Obama Administration left the Trump Administration with few good options to mitigate the increasingly dire situation in Syria, which has generated destabilizing spillover effects that threaten U.S. national security interests and many allies, particularly Israel, Jordan, and Turkey. President Donald Trump and his Administration should work with allies to defeat ISIS, contain the civil war within Syria\u2019s borders to minimize spillover effects that could destabilize U.S. allies, help Syria\u2019s neighbors to shelter refugees so that they can remain close to their homes and stop migrating to Europe, and encourage Arab allies to play a more responsible role in Syria on military, diplomatic, and humanitarian fronts.\n\nObama\u2019s Dismal Record in Syria\n\nThe Obama Administration adopted a cautious stance in Syria that initially ruled out direct military action. It also initially balked at providing arms to Syrian rebel groups, arguing that such a policy would escalate the fighting and lead to higher civilian casualties. Other countries stepped in to fill the vacuum and the fighting worsened anyway, escalating the Syrian crisis into a deepening regional crisis. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other Gulf states threw their support behind various Islamist groups that soon overshadowed nationalist groups and Syrian army defectors within the fragmented opposition camp. U.S. passivity contributed to the meteoric rise of the Islamic State (then known as ISIS), which was much better armed and financed than rival rebel groups and paid its fighters higher salaries.\n\nIn August 2012, President Obama warned the Assad regime not to use illegal chemical weapons. Assad ignored Obama and used chemical weapons repeatedly. In response, Obama reluctantly approved the provision of arms to certain Syrian rebel groups and threatened to bomb Assad\u2019s military forces. The President stepped back from the brink in September 2013 when Moscow seized the initiative by offering to broker a deal that would remove chemical weapons from Syria. The Assad regime paid lip service to the agreement and shipped most of its chemical weapons out of the country, but it continues to use chlorine gas against its own people in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s vacillation on the use of force and failure to enforce his own red line against the use of chemical weapons exposed his Administration as a feckless adversary and unreliable ally. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has applied military force aggressively to prop up the Assad regime and bolster Russia\u2019s regional influence. Putin, correctly anticipating little push back from Obama, sought to present the Trump Administration with a fait accompli that would limit its options.\n\nMoscow\u2019s deployment of missile air defense systems, air power, and limited ground forces already has significantly constrained U.S. military options. Moscow has also sought to undermine U.S. diplomatic options by excluding Washington from the negotiations that produced the December 30 cease-fire and from a formal role in peace talks in Kazakhstan\u2014talks that are aimed at consolidating Assad\u2019s military gains rather than reaching genuine compromises to defuse the war.\n\nTime to Reset U.S. Syria Policy\n\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s half-hearted Syria policy failed disastrously at great cost to U.S. national interests and credibility. The Administration failed to halt the carnage or block Russian, Syrian, and Iranian efforts to impose a military solution. Washington\u2019s alliance network in the Middle East has been weakened and strained, and the emerging Russia\u2013Syria\u2013Iran axis has been strengthened. The biggest losers have been the Syrian people\u2014more than 400,000 of whom have died in the fighting since 2011.\n\nThe Trump Administration should therefore:\n\nWork with allies to defeat ISIS. President Trump has correctly identified the defeat of ISIS as a U.S. priority in Syria. But ISIS is by no means the only Islamist extremist threat there. Al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian affiliate, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (Front for the Conquest of the Levant, or JFS), also poses a threat to the U.S. and has quietly put down deeper roots than ISIS. JFS recently merged with several smaller extremist groups and rebranded itself as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (Organization for the Liberation of the Levant). Moreover, the war in Syria has become a proxy war between Sunni and Shiite extremists, including Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian forces that also pose threats to U.S. interests. Washington has few reliable allies inside Syria. Syrian Kurdish militias tied to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) are an effective military force, but close cooperation with them complicates relations with Turkey. Ankara has been fighting the PKK, which has been designated as a terrorist group by both the U.S. and the European Union, off and on since 1984. The Trump Administration should end U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish militias linked to the PKK. To stabilize Syria in the long run, Washington and Ankara must agree on which groups to support and cooperate closely in providing that support. Non-Islamist rebel groups in northern Syria have been weakened by defections, in part due to a lack of external support, as Turkey threw its support behind the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia and Qatar favored even more radical Salafist groups. But in southern Syria, the Southern Front, a coalition of secular, moderate, and tribal militias supported by Jordan, France, and the U.S., may be more reliable allies, particularly in securing the Jordanian border and preventing ISIS infiltration. Washington should press Turkey, other NATO allies, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf allies to contribute significant ground troops and special operations forces to defeat ISIS on the ground inside Syria. The U.S. could provide advisers, air support, logistical support, airlift, intelligence, surveillance, search and rescue support, and other enablers. Meanwhile, the U.S. should reassess its aid program for Syrian rebels and continue aid only to non-Islamist groups willing and able to fight ISIS effectively. It must also do a better job of vetting them to prevent arms from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nContain and mitigate the destabilizing spillover effects of Syria's civil war. Washington must focus on preventing the fighting from spilling over Syria\u2019s borders to threaten U.S. allies, limiting the flow of refugees to Europe and helping to take care of them closer to their homes, and preventing Syria from becoming a sanctuary for Islamist terrorists. The U.S. should work closely with allies to staunch the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and to monitor and disrupt the flow of Islamist extremists out of Syria. This requires a robust, multi-pronged, global effort to dismantle the foreign-fighter pipeline and counter the radical Islamist ideology that motivates new recruits.[REF] Roughly half of Syria\u2019s 20 million people have been displaced by the fighting, with more than 5 million refugees fleeing the country. Most of the refugees were fleeing from attacks by the Russia\u2013Syria\u2013Iran axis, not from ISIS, which blocked the exit of Syrians from its \u201ccaliphate.\u201d Moscow has \u201cweaponized\u201d the refugees by stampeding them out of Syria, making them an increasing burden on Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and the European Union. President Trump has proposed the establishment of vaguely defined \u201csafe zones\u201d to protect refugees in Syria and the surrounding region. Refugee sanctuaries already exist in Jordan, Iraqi Kurdistan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Washington should offer more humanitarian aid to support refugees there and lighten the burden on the host countries, but it should rule out the deployment of U.S. forces inside Syria to maintain safe zones. This would be a costly, risky, open-ended military mission that would make the U.S. a party to the conflict. The best contribution that Washington can make to protecting Syrian refugees is to focus on defeating ISIS and support a political settlement that ends the fighting and allows the refugees to return home.\n\nAvoid legitimizing the roles of Russia or Iran in Syria. Neither Russia nor Iran is a useful ally against ISIS and both actively undermine U.S. national interests and allies. Russia has paid lip service to the fight against ISIS, but has launched most of its air strikes against other rebel groups, including some supported by the U.S. Siding with Russia, which has been accused of committing war crimes in Syria, would discredit the U.S. in the eyes of most Syrians and many Sunni Arabs outside of Syria. The Trump Administration should not repeat either its predecessor\u2019s overestimation of Moscow\u2019s willingness to cooperate in Syria or its underestimation of Moscow\u2019s interest in undermining U.S. influence in the Middle East. Although most attention has been focused on Russia\u2019s air campaign, Iran and its surrogates have spearheaded most of the Assad regime\u2019s ground offensives. Tehran\u2019s sectarian policies have made a bad situation worse by fueling Sunni Arab support for ISIS in Syria as well as in Iraq. In the long run, Iran poses a much greater threat than ISIS or al-Qaeda.\n\nEncourage Arab allies to play a more responsible military, diplomatic, and humanitarian role in Syria. Some of America\u2019s Arab allies have supported Sunni extremist groups against the Assad regime and Iran, which they view as their greatest enemy. Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia continue to turn a blind eye to the activities of fundraisers for Islamist extremist groups seeking donations from private individuals in their kingdoms. The U.S. should press all of its allies to crack down on the flow of such funds and insist that rebel groups they support break all ties with JFS. Washington also should ask its allies to deploy more military forces to attack ISIS and provide greater aid for Syrian refugees.\n\nAn Important Test Case\n\nHard power wielded by ruthless regimes triumphed over the Obama Administration\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201csmart power\u201d approach to Syria. The Trump Administration has inherited a deteriorating situation in the heart of the Middle East that generates destabilizing spillover effects that threaten many U.S. allies. President Trump should not repeat Obama\u2019s mistakes in trusting Putin\u2019s cynical diplomacy and accommodating Iran. His Administration should concentrate on protecting U.S. national security interests and allies, rather than seeking illusory diplomatic agreements that are quickly violated by its adversaries.\n\nJames Phillips is Senior Research Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.", "President Donald Trump has made it clear that he does not like the flawedand risky 2015 Iran nuclear agreement that he inherited from the Obama administration.\n\nHe called it one of the worst deals ever negotiated during the presidential campaign and declared it to be an \u201cembarrassment\u201d in his speech to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly last month. When asked what he will do about it, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nThe White House has tentatively scheduled a major speech for Thursday that is expected to outline its official policy on the nuclear deal.\n\nDeadlines and Red lines\n\nThe administration faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying the Iran nuclear agreement, which is required every 90 days under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015.\n\nAfter the State Department twice certified the agreement in order to meet 90-day deadlines earlier this year, Trump indicated that he was reluctant to do so again.\n\nAnd it is impossible to see how he could do so. Iran has proclaimed that it will not permit inspections of its military bases, which are both permitted and essential under the nuclear deal.\n\nThis is a far cry from \u201ctransparently, verifiably, and fully implementing\u201d the nuclear agreement, as stipulated under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n\nMoreover, that law obliges the State Department to also certify that it is in the vital national security interests of the United States to continue suspending nuclear sanctions on Iran, as required under the nuclear agreement.\n\nIt is increasingly difficult for the State Department to convince the president that it is vital to the national security interests of the United States to continue granting billions of dollars of sanctions relief to a rogue regime that orchestrates chants of \u201cDeath to America\u201d.\n\nIran exports terrorism, threatens U.S. allies, harasses U.S. Navy warships in the Persian Gulf, defies U.N. Security Council resolutions on ballistic missile tests, arms imports, and arms exports, and arrests innocent American citizens on fabricated charges to hold as hostages.\n\nAll of these actions violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the nuclear agreement. It is therefore likely that the president will decide to refuse to certify the nuclear deal.\n\nThe critical issue that must be addressed in Trump\u2019s speech is what comes after a decision to decertify the nuclear agreement. Will the Trump administration walk away from the nuclear agreement or try to correct its flaws?\n\nNix It or Fix It?\n\nDecertification would not automatically abolish the nuclear deal, but would set the stage for Congress to review the agreement. Congress would then have 60 days to debate whether to restore nuclear-related sanctions lifted by the nuclear deal.\n\nBut before that debate begins, the Trump administration must decide whether to walk away from the agreement or seek to correct its flaws through further negotiations.\n\nWalking away from the agreement could allow Iran to have its cake and eat it, too. Tehran would be relieved of future obligations under the deal, after pocketing many of its benefits in terms of front-loaded sanctions relief.\n\nWashington could re-impose U.S. sanctions, but would not be able to count on the U.N. Security Council to re-impose and enforce U.N. sanctions unless Iran was found to be in material breach of the agreement.\n\nThe United States should also push for an inspection of the Parchin military base, where Iran was suspected of conducting illicit work to advance a nuclear weapons program. If Iran defiantly blocked international inspectors from verifying its compliance with its nuclear commitments, then U.N. sanctions would snap back.\n\nAnother option would be to try to renegotiate the agreement. The administration could request that Congress hold off on re-imposing nuclear-related sanctions for a defined period of time until it became clear whether fixing the nuclear deal is even possible.\n\nThis clearly would be an extremely difficult proposition. Tehran has refused to consider any renegotiation. But, once the administration has decertified the deal and Congress is poised to re-apply sanctions, Tehran may reconsider its refusal to renegotiate.\n\nWork With Congress: Don\u2019t Punt on the Nuclear Issue\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a leading congressional critic of the nuclear deal, has advocated that the administration work with Congress to fix the agreement:\n\nWhat the president should do at this point is outline the parameters of new legislation that he would like to see to greatly strengthen the Nuclear Agreement Review Act to fix some of the problems with the [nuclear deal], while also making it clear to Tehran, and to Europe and Asia, that the sword of Damocles of complete economic sanctions hangs over Iran\u2019s regime to be implemented at any moment by him unilaterally.\n\nTo further enhance its diplomatic bargaining leverage, the administration could ask Congress to authorize the use of military force as a last resort if necessary to prevent an Iranian nuclear breakout.\n\nBut renegotiating the nuclear agreement would be worthwhile only if it permanently barred Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and removed the sunset provisions in the current agreement that allow key restrictions on Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment program to expire after 10 years.\n\nAt a minimum, this would require:\n\nBanning Iran from uranium-enrichment and plutonium-production activities;\n\nDismantling substantial portions of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, particularly the Fordow and Natanz uranium-enrichment facilities and the Arak heavy water reactor;\n\nPerforming robust inspections on an \u201canytime anywhere\u201d basis and real-time monitoring of Iranian nuclear facilities;\n\nEnsuring that Iran comes clean on its past weaponization efforts; and\n\nDetermining a clear and rapid process for re-imposing all sanctions if Iran is caught cheating.\n\nAttaining a nuclear agreement with Iran along these lines may not be possible. But the president should make it clear in his speech that Iran will be responsible for the demise of the nuclear agreement if it continues to block inspections of its military bases and reject further negotiations.\n\nFor more information about this topic:\n\nTime to Decertify the Iran Nuclear Agreement\n\nIran Is Wrong: Trump Can Absolutely Overturn the Nuclear Deal\n\nThe Dangerous Regional Implications of the Iran Nuclear Agreement\n\nThe Nuclear Deal Has Not Changed Iran\n\nThe Most Glaring Flaws in Obama\u2019s Iran Deal", "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for a merit-based immigration system has billionaire George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation in hysterics.\n\nDuring an interview with the New York Times, former Obama White House immigration official and current strategic advisor for Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation Angela Maria Kelley said the immigration plan would \u201cmake life as miserable as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf your single goal is to make life as miserable as possible for those who are here without status, then it\u2019s about as effective as you can get,\u201d Kelley told the Times.\n\nWhen asked specifically on the Trump budget\u2019s proposal to end giving tax credits to illegal immigrants in the U.S., making it so that individuals claiming the child tax credit must give a valid Social Security Number, Kelley responded with more horror.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ignoring the fact that these are also programs that benefit U.S. citizen children, and that this is much more likely to push people further underground than it is to push people out of the country,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nThe Trump immigration plan included in his budget proposal will take the first steps create a merit-based immigration system, where instead of legal immigrants who already have family in the U.S. getting priority, legal immigrants who have skills needed for the current U.S. economy will be given priority.

As Breitbart Texas reported, the Soros-backed media outlet \u2018ProPublica\u2019 released a hit piece on Trump\u2019s nominee, Lee Francis Cissna, to run the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).", "A group purporting to be a television production company, \u201cAmerica First Television\u201d \u2014 or, alternatively, \u201cTrueMedia Television\u201d \u2014 is running a sophisticated scam to trick outspoken conservatives to appear as guests on a brand new television show they\u2019ve dubbed a \u201cconservative version of Sesame Street.\u201d\n\nA woman who identified herself as \u201cField Producer, Alexis McKinnon\u201d contacted me initially via a publicly-listed email address on my Facebook public profile:\n\nDear Tom (sic), My name is Alexis and I am writing to you on behalf of America First Television.

Best, Alexis\n\nLater, \u201cAlexis\u201d assured me that the company had seen that I had appeared in a number of documentaries, and that I had a radio show and a book out.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re remarkably unpolished,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for \u2014 someone genuine, someone who\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I was sold. She hit just the right notes of flattery and realism, and I took the bait \u2014 hook, line and sinker.\n\nI asked her who else had accepted the invite to be a guest.\n\nShe told me that because of the nature of the names involved, there was a need for absolute secrecy.\n\nMy wife, Rowena, was not bowled over.\n\nShe kept asking questions \u2014 and I kept reassuring her.\n\nProverbs 16:18 warns that \u201c[p]ride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall\u201d \u2014 and believe me, there was no shortage of pride as I daydreamed about being involved in a project that could reverse decades of indoctrination.\n\nI confirmed a date and time, and agreed to participate.\n\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a set-up?\u201d My wife kept asking me. In order to keep me out of trouble, she arranged to take the day off work and travel with me to the North Hollywood sound stage.\n\nWe arranged to meet \u201cAlexis\u201d at a coffee shop near the sound stage off Cahuenga Blvd.\n\nMy wife kept telling me she had a sense that something wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u201cAlexis\u201d showed up with another \u201cField Producer\u201d in tow, named \u201cJordan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexis\u201d went to buy coffee and \u201cJordan\u201d sat down with us and launched into a story about how \u201cpro-life\u201d he was and how his wife had just lost a baby to stillbirth \u2014 and became all choked up. He went on to talk about a television series he had produced about women who had made the decision to have Down Syndrome kids, even though the technology existed to identify the symptoms early enough to abort their pregnancies.\n\nAs we had a few moments, I asked both of them about the setup and the script again. \u201cAlexis\u201d assured me that I would love the script, but that the program wanted me to be \u201cunscripted.\u201d\n\nMore flattery forestalled any answers to the nagging questions.\n\nWhen Rowena asked why she could not be on set, she was told there were rules about parents keeping children in line of sight, and they wanted my interaction with the kids to be \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201cunrehearsed.\u201d\n\nAfter investing so much, I really wanted to see the project through. But I still thought it strange they wanted to keep me separated from Rowena.\n\nJust before 2:00 p.m., I was driven to the sound stage by \u201cAlexis\u201d \u2014 and that is when things became really strange.\n\nI was rushed directly into position for live shooting with very little instruction. I kept pushing away the doubts by telling myself: this is a small set production by a newly-formed group that is conservative, so it is most likely underfunded. They did tell me that I would be directed to look at the teleprompter when they wanted me to speak or sing something.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of shooting, it became clear the whole thing was indeed a setup \u2014 and I walked off the set. The skits had an overwhelmingly racist overtone \u2014 almost as if a caricature of how the left views conservatives \u2014 rather than how conservatives really are.\n\nThe harder the producers tried to convince me to stay, the more clearly I could see their intent. One producer said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so upset, I\u2019m a Republican,\u201d holding up his red tie as if that was proof positive that everything was ok \u2014 and I should just ignore my instincts.\n\nMy wife was right.\n\nIt was creepy to realize the lengths the left will go to in order to make conservatives look bad, instead of simply debating us on the battleground of ideas.\n\nI tried finding out more about the company. In response to my question about who was behind the whole production, I was told about a \u201cTim Watkins\u201d of Orlando, and given his phone number. And they assured me that another conservative had not had issues with the script. When I asked whom, he said, \u201cShannon Grove, Assemblywoman \u2026 but she didn\u2019t complete the whole show.\u201d\n\nI called Shannon, a colleague with whom I served in the Assembly, and discovered that she had a \u201chinky\u201d feeling about the whole thing \u2014 and fortunately, due to a scheduling conflict \u2014 never made it to the sound stage.\n\nSo I decided to try the phone number for \u201cTim Watkins.\u201d It worked the day I called it, but was answered only by a generic voicemail message. As of this writing, none of the phone numbers work. They seem to be covering their tracks.\n\nI also contacted CBS to find out if they had any relationship with the company or the program. They do not.\n\nI\u2019ve sent the company a letter rescinding any consent to be part of its \u201cfake TV\u201d show, and have threatened legal action should they be foolish enough to cut-and-paste any of their footage to make me look bad.\n\nMy wife assures me that I can look bad without any help from them.\n\nLet my experience be a warning to other conservatives: beware this \u201cfake TV\u201d group claiming to be affiliated specifically with CBS, among other mainstream media outlets.\n\nThey have already targeted other outspoken conservative leaders in California, including Debbie Bacigalupi, who has been an ardent activist/speaker against Agenda 21 and the climate change agenda.\n\nBacigalupi, who was contacted by the same \u201cJulia Cahillane\u201d who had previously targeted Shannon Grove, told me: \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken to see people use children and millenials to advance a socialist/collectivist agenda choosing smear tactics instead of debating their ideas out in the open on the public stage \u2014 and letting the people decide.\u201d\n\nTim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.

But America First Policies, the political nonprofit designated as Trump's official outside group, is not ruling out getting involved in the Dec. 12 contest.\n\nThe president in recent days has spoken approvingly of Moore and urged Alabama voters to reject Democratic nominee Doug Jones. American First Policies, which takes its cues from the White House although it is forbidden from coordinating, then released a poll showing Moore climbing back into the race after seeing his support plummet as voters absorbed news of his alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nThe move and commentary from American First Policies president Brian O.

Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he wrote in the name of another candidate when he cast his early vote.\n\nWith the new zero-tolerance policy taking hold for men in politics, media, and entertainment who are credibly accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault, Republicans could be in a tough spot if Moore defeats Jones later this month. Democrats face similar challenges, as they grapple with how to deal with Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who has been accused of groping, and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who has been accused of sexual harassment.\n\nMoore's presence in the Senate could taint Republicans running for office in 2018. Moving to expel him could put Senate Republicans at odds with Trump, who has tacitly endorsed Moore, not to mention cause a backlash from the party's conservative base that is supportive of the president. America First Policies' participation in the Alabama campaign would give Moore a sort of official GOP seal of approval that other Republicans might have to answer for.\n\nThe group fielded two polls in November. The first, held Nov. 13-15, showed Jones leading Moore 49 percent to 41 percent. The second, held Nov. 26-28, showed Moore ahead 46 percent to 45 percent.

But all of us can agree on at least one prediction for 2018: Whatever goes wrong next year, roughly half of all Americans will tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s all Trump\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nNow on to some serious forecasting. Here are five foreign policy stories that will dominate next year\u2019s news.\n\n5. All North Korea all the time. You think Donald Trump likes the spotlight? Compared to Kim Jong-un, he\u2019s a wallflower. Rocket Man can\u2019t stand it when other countries ignore him. Only, instead of tweeting for attention, he launches an ICBM or triggers a nuclear bomb.\n\nKim\u2019s bad behavior will continue in 2018, keeping nerves on edge from Seoul to Tokyo to Washington. But, in practical terms, the perpetual, Kim-induced crisis isn\u2019t likely to escalate. That\u2019s because, over time, the Great Leader\u2019s ability to threaten the United States and our allies will increasingly be eclipsed by our capacity to defend against this odious regime.\n\n4. 2018 is election year in Russia and Putin will once again win big. His fellow kleptocrats in the Kremlin will make sure of that. Indeed, they\u2019ve already started. On Christmas Day, Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission formally barred opposition leader Alexei Navalny from running for president. Navalny has now called for an election boycott. Expect Russian officials to report record turnout ... and a 90 percent victory margin for Putin.\n\n3. Over the last few years, the leader of Turkey has become one of the most unpredictable leaders in the world. That\u2019s because, he seems to have no clear policy goal other than consolidating power at home. Abroad, he practices trampoline diplomacy, bouncing all over the place. We would worry less if he wasn\u2019t (1) a key leader in one of the most unstable parts of the world and (2) the head of a NATO member nation. Erratic and unreliable behavior is unwelcome on both scores.\n\n2. Washington\u2019s tango with Tehran won\u2019t be pretty. The Trump administration has branded the country an adversarial, disruptive power and all but declared the Iran Deal a failure. The administration is right on both counts. But so far, the basic strategy for dealing with the problems seems to be butting heads.\n\nAt the same time, there is a war to be won fighting the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Don\u2019t expect to get though the year without this trilogy of bad actors \u2014 Iran, ISIS and al-Qaida \u2014 making headlines you really don\u2019t want to see.\n\n1. Of course, the relationship between Beijing and Washington is going to get way worse. You don\u2019t need a fortune cookie to predict that. And, it won\u2019t be just about economic competition. The United States and China will be chest bumping over diplomacy, regional security and global politics as well.\n\nIn the end, China will disappoint in its promise to help with North Korea. And Beijing won\u2019t back off its efforts to secure control of the South China Seas. Meanwhile, the United States and China will likely spar about different points along Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBlame Trump if you want to, but the world of 2018 was going to be a messier place regardless of who sits in the Oval Office.\n\nAt least, now America seems to have awakened to the fact that doing less is as dangerous as trying to do too much.\n\nIt is hoped in 2018 Washington can strike the right balance: demonstrating enough toughness to force the bad guys to back off, without creating more problems for our military and diplomatic forces to solve.", "Every year, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) publishes a report on the number of casualties caused by land mines\u2014or so it says.\n\nAnd every year, gullible journalists take the report\u2019s headline figure at face value.\n\nBut this year, the worst offender is a particularly prestigious outlet: The New York Times, whose Editorial Board authored a column titled, \u201cWhy Do Land Mines Still Kill So Many?\u201d\n\nThe Gray Lady writes:\n\nThe world is rolling backward, and at a disturbingly faster pace, in the struggle to limit carnage from land mines and other booby-trap explosives.

But were all those people actually injured or killed by land mines?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nIf you turn to page 57 of the ICBL\u2019s report, you\u2019ll find that only 732 people were injured or killed by an anti-personnel land mine, another 495 by an anti-vehicle mine, and another 538 by an \u201cunspecified\u201d mine.\n\nThat\u2019s 1,765 people, not 8,605.\n\nThe Times says that casualties to land mines are rising. But the ICBL\u2019s report says that in 2015, 2,002 people were injured or killed by these kinds of mines. So casualties are actually down by 237, not up.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a cause for modest celebration\u2014but no, apparently it\u2019s not.\n\nTrue, measuring casualty trends by using the latest ICBL press release is a fool\u2019s errand, because its own reported numbers fluctuate. A lot.\n\nLast year, the ICBL asserted that 2015 saw 6,461 casualties. Now, it says that 2015 had 6,967 casualties.\n\nI don\u2019t object to updating these figures over time as better information becomes available, but comparing this year\u2019s casualties to last year\u2019s based on the latest ICBL report is not going to produce reliable calculations.\n\nThe Times\u2019 Obsession With Cluster Bombs\n\nThe Times goes on to claim that \u201c[o]ne subset of the menace, cluster munitions, is singularly vicious. \u2026 All too often, they fail to detonate right away and thus become time bombs\u2026. Cluster munitions alone caused 971 known casualties in 2016.\u201d\n\nClearly, the Times asserts that dud cluster bombs are responsible for those casualties.\n\nBut the ICBL\u2019s report contradicts this claim, saying that the number of people killed and injured by dud cluster munitions was 114\u2014not 971. The 971 figure includes the people who were directly and immediately killed by cluster munitions that exploded on impact, mostly dropped by the Syrian Air Force. That\u2019s completely different from dud munitions.\n\nThe Times\u2019 fixation on cluster munitions is puzzling to me. I don\u2019t see how being killed by a cluster bomb is any worse than being killed by a 500-lb bomb. In fact, the bigger bomb would probably cause more damage, and casualties, than the smaller ones.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to those 8,605 casualties. Where does the Times get that number from?\n\nWell, what the ICBL has done is the same thing they do every year: combine all land mine casualties together with all casualties from improvised explosive devices and all explosive leftovers (known as \u201cexplosive remnants of war\u201d).\n\nAnd then, journalists come along and report that all those casualties were caused by land mines.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Well, it happened in 2014. And in 2015. And in 2016.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that some improvised explosive devices do qualify, legally, as land mines. But that\u2019s not what caused the big jump in 2016 casualties, when casualties from improvised explosive devices increased by only 257.\n\nThe casualty increase came almost entirely from the \u201cUnknown mine/explosive remnants of war item\u201d category, which leapt from 1,410 in 2015 to 3,843 in 2016.\n\nWe can\u2019t say whether these casualties were caused by land mines and, in fact, it\u2019s likely that most of them were caused by dud bombs, not land mines at all, as almost all these casualties came in Yemen and Libya. Both of those countries saw heavy fighting in 2016.\n\nThe Times then moans that \u201cperhaps the saddest part of all this is that for well over a decade the world seemed to have gotten a grip on what are referred to generically as the \u2018explosive remnants of war,\u2019\u201d for which it thanks a 1999 treaty banning victim-activated anti-personnel land mines.\n\nWrong, wrong, wrong. That 1999 treaty isn\u2019t about explosive remnants of war. It\u2019s about anti-personnel land mines only. If casualties from explosive remnants of war are going up (and they seem to be), it\u2019s got nothing to do with the treaty.\n\nThere is, however, an explosive remnants of war protocol, adopted in 2003. Too bad the anti-land mine activists hate the process that produced it. Why do they hate it? Because they don\u2019t want agreements that control weapons. They just want to ban them.\n\nOf course, the Times doesn\u2019t know that context. It also doesn\u2019t seem to know the context on funding for land mine clearance\u2014even though they reported on it in 2016.\n\nBack then, the Times cheered, \u201c32 donors, led by the United States, contributed nearly $480 million \u2026 for mine clearance and victim aid. That was an increase of 22 percent from the year before.\u201d\n\nBut the year before, funding dropped by 14 percent. So actually, funding\u2014after a three-year drop that began in 2013\u2014is now almost exactly where it was back in 2010. U.S. funding did fall slightly, but most of the decline came from Japan, the European Union, and especially Norway.\n\nNow most of those donors have restored or increased their funding. There\u2019s not much of a story here.\n\nTreaties Will Solve Everything, Right?\n\nSo what does the Times propose we do about these supposed 8,605 casualties? Well, sign more treaties, of course.\n\nSays the Times:\n\n[T]he land mine and cluster munitions treaties are undercut by the refusal of some of modern warfare\u2019s most powerful players to sign them. \u2026 Washington is not immune to moral suasion\u2026 . [Signing would be] a moral statement encouraging others to follow suit.\n\nAre you seriously telling me you believe that, if the U.S. got rid of its land mines, ISIS would stop using improvised explosive devices and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would stop bombing his own population?\n\nYou have to be very stupid to believe that. But apparently, the New York Times Editorial Board does believe it.\n\nIt gets better. Why hasn\u2019t the U.S. gotten rid of its land mines? Because South Korea uses mines to defend itself against North Korea, and South Korea is an ally of ours.\n\nBut according to the Times, \u201cgiven the North\u2019s nuclear buildup, a mined DMZ seems to be a Cold War vestige of diminished value.\u201d\n\nSo because North Korea has nuclear weapons, we should abandon our land mines? I\u2019m glad the Times wasn\u2019t advising NATO on how to defend Western Europe during the Cold War.\n\nOne of the successes of 2017, according to the land mine ban advocates, was that Sri Lanka joined the 1999 treaty in December. According to the banners, that was because Sri Lanka did not \u201cwant to be associated with such an obsolete, abhorrent weapon.\u201d Hah.\n\nActually, what happened was that in 2009 the Sri Lankan government won its brutal, 25-year-long civil war, during which it used land mines in enormous quantities. Now that it\u2019s crushed its rebels, it doesn\u2019t need land mines any more, so it joined the treaty. That\u2019s the way these things work.\n\nThe Real Reason for Casualty Increases\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase. Why are the casualties that ICBL tracks going up?\n\nNot because of land mines, or the 1999 treaty, or the fact the U.S. hasn\u2019t signed it. They\u2019re going up because the last few years have seen a lot of very bloody and indiscriminate wars during which a lot of improvised explosive devices were used, and those wars have left a lot of dud bombs lying around.\n\nIf those wars continue, and if improvised explosive device use continues to spread (as it assuredly will), casualties will go up. If they stop, casualties will in time go down. That\u2019s it.\n\nTo be fair, the ICBL mischaracterizes its own findings too, so we shouldn\u2019t just blame lazy, left-wing journalists. When the ICBL released its report back in December, it claimed that \u201ca few intense conflicts \u2026 have resulted in very high numbers of mine casualties.\u201d\n\nIf you took the word \u201cmine\u201d out of that sentence, it would be correct. But the ICBL can\u2019t resist hyping its own cause.\n\nBack in 2014, the land mine banners were crowing that their favorite treaty was making land mines a \u201cweapon of the past.\u201d But in the same year, when I looked at this issue for the first time, I made this prediction. It\u2019s turned out to be completely correct:\n\nThe amount of unexploded ordnance in the world\u2014and the number of [improvised explosive devices] used and [anti-personnel land mines] laid\u2014is a lagged function of the number and viciousness of the world\u2019s wars. The late 1980s and 1990s saw a lot of these wars, in Afghanistan, Colombia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, and the former Yugoslavia, among other places. It\u2019s not surprising that, as some of these wars cooled and unexploded [ordnance] was cleared, the number of casualties recorded by ICBL for its Landmine Report has declined. As war has come to Syria and Ukraine, and returned to Afghanistan, the next decade is likely to see more casualties. The anti-land-mine treaty is largely irrelevant to these trends.\n\nOf course, the Times closes by blaming President Donald Trump. If only he wasn\u2019t such a meanie, it sniffs, the U.S. would give up on cluster munitions, sign the land mines ban, and that good old moral suasion would kick into effect.\n\nNonsense.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that moral suasion isn\u2019t going to work on Assad and ISIS, all of these 2016 casualties\u2014every one of them\u2014occurred when President Barack Obama was leading from behind.\n\nMaybe what was needed then\u2014and now\u2014wasn\u2019t more U.S. signatures on treaties. Maybe it was more U.S. leadership to stop, or to win, those wars in Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan.", "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Central European University said Tuesday that government-proposed amendments to Hungary\u2019s law on higher education \u201cwould make it impossible to continue its operations\u201d in Budapest, its home for over 25 years.\n\nUniversity President and Rector Michael Ignatieff said in a statement that the closure of the school founded by U.S. billionaire George Soros \u201cwould damage Hungarian academic life and negatively impact the government of Hungary\u2019s relations\u201d with its neighbors, its fellow European Union members and the United States.\n\nThe university, most of whose nearly 1,800 students are Hungarian, said provisions in the draft bill submitted to parliament by Zoltan Balog, the minister who oversees education, are specifically meant to damage the school. They include an obligation for CEU to open a campus in New York state, where it is also accredited, allowing it to award degrees accepted both in Hungary and the U.S.\n\nThe proposed amendment would also eliminate a waiver allowing academic staff from non-EU countries to be employed at the university without a work permit and force the institution to change its name.\n\nIgnatieff proposed talks with the government to find \u201ca satisfactory way forward that allows CEU to continue in Budapest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will defend our achievements vigorously against anyone who seeks to defame our work in the eyes of the Hungarian people,\u201d he said.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban is a former Soros scholarship recipient, but he has been increasingly critical of the Hungarian-born philanthropist, accusing him of wanting to influence Hungarian politics and supporting mass migration into Europe. The populist Orban is leading a crackdown on migrants.\n\nOrban\u2019s governing Fidesz party says it wants new rules on non-governmental organizations that receive international funding, such as the Soros-supported corruption watchdog Transparency International and the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAn early support of U.S. President Donald Trump, Orban is staunchly anti-migration and his government on Tuesday began applying disputed asylum rules allowing the detention in border camps of asylum-seekers, including unaccompanied children over 14.\n\nThe government has also been very critical of a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that awarded compensation to two asylum-seekers from Bangladesh found to have been illegally detained and deported from Hungary in 2015. They are represented by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which has also received funds from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations.", "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has declared that conservatives \u201cmust fight\u201d against an international campaign to abolish national borders linked to billionaire financier George Soros.\n\n\u201cInternational asylum law makes it clear that no one in the world has the right to choose where they want to live, and every country has its own population. For someone to live somewhere other than where they were born, they also need the consent of the people who live there,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told Kossuth R\u00e1di\u00f3.\n\n\u201cIf someone wants to live in Hungary, they must seek the permission of the Hungarian people. There can be no international principle, norm, court or organisation which says that it doesn\u2019t matter what the Hungarian people think about their own country and about whom they want to live together with, and that someone else will decide for us. This is impossible,\u201d he said, addressing questions about a European Court of Human Rights ruling ordering Hungary to pay compensation to two deported Bangladeshis.\n\n\u201cThere is no such international principle. There is, however, a well-established international campaign, which has been ongoing for more than a decade. It can be linked to the name of George Soros, and it seeks to prove that borders make no sense, and that nations have no right to decide for themselves whom they wish their peoples to live together with.\n\n\u201cAccording to this, international legal institutions must be created to oversee the nations and to tell us or decide for us who may live where, and together with whom. There is even an extensive intellectual support framework for this, and a number of high-profile works have been published on this subject. These are extremely dangerous.\n\n\u201cSo let me repeat: these [open borders theories] are conceived in the Soros workshop, and these have also infiltrated a number of international institutions. We must fight these battles. We must argue against them. We must make their operations transparent, and we must make clear that often it\u2019s not about the principles of human rights, but about greed and the migrant business.\u201d\n\nThe Fidesz leader also heaped praise on the \u201cyoung Hungarians in the uniforms of the military and the police defending the safety of the Hungarian people in difficult circumstances\u201d at the borders, and poured scorn on pro-migration NGOs which \u201caccuse them of not doing their job properly, saying that in fact they\u2019re wolves in human form who take pleasure in physically abusing the migrants who come here\u201d.\n\nOrb\u00e1n denounced this as a \u201cmonstrous lie\u201d, and restated his commitment to preventing such groups from undermining the country\u2019s robust and effective migration policy with foreign money without any transparency about their financing.\n\n\u201cAfter all, what\u2019s the point of these young Hungarians defending the Hungarian border if international networks then open up all sorts of legal loopholes? Why do they apprehend illegal border crossers, why do they risk their own physical safety, if all along these networks in Budapest and Brussels treacherously undermine us with legal loopholes?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI must say that in my view this situation is morally untenable. These NGOs, or non-governmental organisations as they call themselves, aren\u2019t civil society organisations. They have nothing to do with civil society organisations \u2026 they have been profiteering at our expense. This is what is happening.

The United States vetoed a critical Security Council resolution, but the General Assembly subsequently voted 128 to nine (with thirty-five abstentions and twenty-one countries not present) to condemn the decision.\n\nLast month, prior to the General Assembly vote, Ambassador Nikki Haleywarned that the United States would be \u201ctaking names\u201d of countries voting in favor of the resolution.\n\nAt the UN we're constantly asked to do more and give more\u2014in the past we have. So, when we make a decision, at the will of the American people, about where to locate OUR embassy, we don't expect those we've helped to target us. On Thursday there will be a vote at the UN criticizing our choice. And yes, the U.S. will be taking names.\n\nThe vote exposed two problems that frequently coincide: (1) U.S. aid recipients often take\u2014without repercussions\u2014positions contrary to those taken by the United States in the UN and (2) Palestinians frequently use the organization to harass and isolate the United States and Israel.\n\nThe resolution deploring U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital was only the latest example of this phenomenon. Just a month earlier, for example, the General Assembly voted 191 to two to condemn the \u201ceconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.\u201d\n\nThis is commonplace, more than a vote here and there. On overall non-consensus votes in the General Assembly, voting coincidence with the United States has averaged only 34.5 percent since 1983, the first year the State Department reported on the matter. Voting coincidence with the U.S. exceeded 50 percent only three times: in 1995, 2011 and 2016.\n\nMajor recipients of U.S. assistance are among the least supportive voters. Why is the United States so frequently unable to convince governments that receive millions or billions of dollars from us to support our priorities in the UN?\n\nIn some cases, the United States simply does not try very hard to convince them. After all, General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding. Most have little to zero practical impact in the world outside of Turtle Bay.\n\nBut sometimes, the United States cares deeply about the result and tries to convince countries to vote with us. This is most likely to happen when votes involve sensitive political issues or international agreements and financial matters within the authority of the General Assembly. In fact, U.S. law requires the State Department to file an annual report to Congress on voting in the UN that identifies \u201cvotes on issues which directly affected important United States interests and on which the United States lobbied extensively.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, there were fourteen such \u201cimportant votes.\u201d The United States was in the majority on nine of them. Of the five that we lost, three involved issues related to the Palestinians.\n\nShifting votes on controversial issues in the General Assembly is difficult. It\u2019s a hotbed of peer pressure and transactional politics. Countries know from experience that, if they support regional or ideological group positions, those governments will in turn support them in matters they care about.\n\nThey are less certain about the ramifications of voting against the United States. Historically the United States has not consistently rewarded countries for their support, nor withheld assistance in response to opposition. As a result, many countries believe that they can oppose American priorities and initiatives without consequences.\n\nThis is particularly the case with votes on Palestinian matters.\n\nSince the 1990s, according to the Congressional Research Service, the United States has given the Palestinians $5 billion in bilateral economic assistance and support. It has supported the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to the tune of $6 billion.\n\nDespite this support, the Palestinians have repeatedly walked away from peace negotiations, refused to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state, instigated violence against Israel, and used the UN to attack and harass Israel by, among other efforts, working to pass three times as many General Assembly resolutions condemning Israel and the rest of the world\u2019s countries combined.\n\nThe sad truth is that, over the past two decades, the United States has established a pattern of funding the Palestinians regardless of their intransigence and provocations.\n\nContrary to the wishes of multiple American administrations, the Palestinians continue their effort to achieve recognition absent a peace agreement with Israel by seeking membership in international organizations and accession tomultilateral treaties. They also use international organizations like the ICC,UNESCO, and the Human Rights Council to isolate, harass, and condemn Israel. Why change their behavior when they believe that there will be no diplomatic or financial repercussions?\n\nIf the Trump administration wants to succeed in brokering a peace deal, this pattern must be broken. The Palestinians must understand that U.S. support is contingent on their commitment to peace negotiations.\n\nThe current dispute over UNRWA funding within the administration presents an opportunity for the United States to clarify the situation. UNRWA was established more than sixty years ago as a temporary initiative to address the needs of Palestinian refugees and facilitate their resettlement and/or repatriation. It has become a permanent institution providing services to multiple generations of Palestinians, a large majority of whom live outside of refugee camps, enjoy citizenship in other countries, or reside in the Palestinian-governed territories. Meanwhile, the Palestinian refugee problem has ostensibly grown larger, in part due to UNRWA\u2019s applying refugee status to the descendants of the original Palestinian refugees. UNRWA has employed individuals affiliated with the Palestinian Islamist extremist group Hamas and its facilities have been used to house rockets and Hamas tunnels. On top of everything else, a UN audit concluded that UNRWA was vulnerable to \u201cmisappropriation, graft and corruption in procurement, partner selection, food and cash distribution, hiring and promotions, and other areas.\u201d\n\nLeaving aside the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the United States should withhold contributions to UNRWA until it implements critical reforms. In the medium term, Washington should seek to eliminate UNRWA, shifting responsibility for recent Palestinian refugees resulting from the war in Syria to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We should also demand that the Palestinians assume responsibility for the services provided by UNRWA. That\u2019s what sovereign governments are expected to do, and the Palestinians aspire to become a sovereign state.\n\nAre there risks to this policy? Of course, but risks are also inherent in adhering to the same policies that have led to the deeply unsatisfactory, insecure status quo. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama all failed in their ambition to negotiate a peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. Success hinges on the Palestinians understanding that there is a cost to their intransigence.\n\nWhen Ambassador Haley announced that the United States was taking names, she implied that there would be consequences for voting against the United States and rewards for supporting America. President Trump followed up and made clear that voting for the condemnation would affect U.S. decisions to provide foreign assistance:\n\nLet them vote against us; we'll save a lot. We don't care. But this isn't like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars and nobody knows what they're doing.\n\nAmerica\u2019s influence is due in no small part to the belief of other governments that the Trump administration will follow through on its promises. Failing to follow through will undermine U.S. credibility in Turtle Bay and around the world. Not every UN vote is important, but if the United States wants to influence important votes in the future, it needs to do more than take names.", "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 The Hungarian government should engage in \u201cserious, urgent and good-faith talks\u201d with Central European University about legal changes seen to be targeting the school founded by billionaire George Soros, a U.S. diplomat said Tuesday.\n\nA bill signed Monday by President Janos Ader sets new conditions for foreign universities in Hungary, some of which seem aimed specifically at CEU. The law requires universities in Hungary also to have a campus in their home countries. While CEU is accredited in Hungary and in New York state, it does not have a U.S. campus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about the legislation,\u201d U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Hoyt Yee told The Associated Press. \u201cThe legislation targets Central European University and threatens the ability of the university, an important American-Hungarian institution, to continue operating in Hungary.\u201d\n\nThe law also calls for bilateral agreements between Hungary and the home countries of universities from outside the European Union on how to manage the institutions.\n\nYee said \u201cthe United States does not engage in such agreements about \u2026 how universities are going to be run in foreign countries. This is a matter for the government of Hungary and CEU to work out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that the government of Hungary is going to engage in serious, urgent and good-faith talks with Central European University, as well as other affected institutions,\u201d Yee said during a visit to Budapest Tuesday.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the issue had wider implications.\n\n\u201cThe legislation, we believe, can also similarly threaten operations of other American universities with degree programs in Hungary,\u201d Toner told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re urging the government of Hungary to suspend implementation of the law. We want to see a review, a discussion in order to address any concerns through dialogue with the university itself and other affected institutions.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Michael Roth, said he expressed \u201cincomprehension\u201d about the foreign universities bill and its targeting of CEU at a meeting Tuesday with Hungary\u2019s ambassador in Berlin, Peter Imre Gyorkos.\n\n\u201cA lot that is happening in Hungary at the moment fills us with genuine concern,\u201d Roth said in a statement. \u201cWe are seeing that Hungary is taking an ever-stronger course of confrontation with the EU and its institutions.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban, who briefly studied at Oxford University in 1989 thanks to a Soros scholarship, is an avowed ideological foe of the Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist\u2019s \u201copen society\u201d ideal, which contrasts with Orban\u2019s plan to turn Hungary into what he calls an \u201cilliberal state.\u201d\n\nOrban says Soros, through his support for non-governmental groups like rights advocate the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, is trying to influence Hungarian politics and opposes Hungarian interests by supporting refugees and migrants.\n\n\u201cThe final debate is about the migration question,\u201d Lajos Kosa, parliamentary leader of Orban\u2019s Fidesz party, said on broadcaster TV2. \u201cThis is why the Hungarian government and the empire directed by Soros are straining against each other.\u201d", "As lawmakers gear up for the next round of changes to how the Defense Department buys weapons, some experts are saying Congress should go easy on a short-staffed Pentagon.\n\nIn recent years, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has released a standalone acquisition reform bill that ends up getting folded into the National Defense Authorization Act when it is introduced later in the year. Past years have seen some radical changes, including the separation of the Pentagon's top acquisition, technology and logistics role into two jobs that focus on business and innovation in the fiscal 2017 bill.\n\nThe acquisition bill from Thornberry is expected in April and will focus on \"defense contracting, data transparency and contract auditing reform,\" according to a letter Thornberry sent to Rep. Diane Black, the chairman of the Budget Committee, this month.\n\nBut Tom Spoehr, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, said he's hoping the fiscal 2018 bill makes fewer changes than in past years because many Pentagon positions are not yet filled in Trump's administration and to give the department some time to see how past reforms are working before Congress makes more.\n\n\"It's like trying to diagnose a sick patient. You try one drug, and before it takes effect, shoot them with another drug,\" Spoehr said. \"You don't know whether that one drug worked or whether it's the new drug.\"\n\nBecause of the late passage of the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill and the turnover that comes with a new administration, Spoehr said the reforms passed in last year's bill \"have barely even been started.\n\n\"It's fair to say that I think they should take a little bit of a break on acquisition reform and let the system digest all these big things,\" he said.\n\nBut Andrew Hunter, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that, while allowing the Pentagon to catch its breath could be a good thing, it's something that's been discussed before but rarely actually happens.\n\n\"Every year that I have been involved in acquisition reform for last 20 years, someone has said we really ought to take a time out, the system needs time to recover,\" Hunter said. \"There's a fair amount of truth in that, but it never happens. Thornberry is going to introduce a bill, and it's going to have a bunch of stuff in it.\"\n\nA spokesman for Thornberry declined to get into details of what might be in the acquisition proposal, but the congressman told reporters this month that he has previously struggled to find partners to work on reforms in President Barack Obama's Pentagon.\n\n\"Reform can be most successful when we do it in partnership, and I am anxious to have a willing partner to work with on all these reform ideas,\" he said.\n\nThe letter from Thornberry said one area of focus will be reforms to the contract auditing process at the Pentagon. While Pentagon contracts were previously all audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, a section of the fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act allowed the agency to accept commercial audits if certain conditions are met.\n\nScott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, said he worried that opening the audit process to more privatization could ultimately \"allow contractors to get away with a lot more\" and harm the taxpayer.\n\nHunter also said that Thornberry could try to tackle reforms to give the military more flexibility to move money between research and development and procurement accounts, as well as to let the burdensome, bureaucratic acquisition process move quicker in areas where technology is evolving more quickly. Thornberry could also work to reform how the Pentagon buys services, which make up a large portion of the department's budget, Hunter said.", "Lockheed Martin is looking to expand its foreign sales, a goal that will be largely driven by sales of the F-35 to international partners, the company's CEO said Tuesday.\n\nMarillyn Hewson told reporters at Lockheed Martin's media day that she is \"more optimistic than ever\" about the company's prospects for growth, including selling more aircraft overseas.\n\nThe company's $12.7 billion in international sales last year made up more than a quarter of the company's total sales, Hewson said. In addition, about 40 percent of new business in 2016 came from international partners.\n\nHewson said the goal is for international sales to make up 30 percent of the company's total in the coming years, mostly driven by sales of the F-35, which is being developed and purchased by international partners.\n\nMost partners are buying the A-variant of the F-35, which is the conventional takeoff and landing platform also used by the U.S. Air Force. That version cost $94.6 million for each copy in the most recent lot of aircraft, announced in February, but the cost is expected to drop to $85 million or less per plane by fiscal 2019, Hewson said.\n\nDriving down the cost of the F-35 has been a key part of Hewson's multiple conversations with President Trump, who repeatedly slammed the fifth-generation joint strike fighter prior to his inauguration. Since then, he has taken credit for driving down the cost in the lot that was released in February.\n\nHewson also talked about a coming increase in defense spending, both in the U.S. and abroad. She said the fiscal 2018 budget proposal from Trump's administration brings an \"important increase\" in U.S. defense spending after years of budget caps. Trump would spend $603 billion on base national defense in fiscal 2018, a $54 billion boost over Budget Control Act levels, but the plan faces an uphill battle on Capitol Hill.\n\nShe also talked about an increase in overseas defense spending as NATO allies strive to live up to the promise to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense following criticism from Trump during the campaign.\n\nIf NATO members were to meet this commitment, a $100 billion increase in defense spending would occur across the alliance, Hewson said.", "FiveThirtyEight Gets Land Mine Data Wrong and Makes It Look like a Bad Treaty Is Working\n\nBy Ted R. Bromund \u2014 December 11, 2014\n\nLast week, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Brittany Lyte wrote that casualties caused by land mines fell 25 percent in 2013, to 3,308, the lowest level on record, supposedly because of increasing compliance with the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. But the decline may not exist \u2013 and if it does, that treaty, which President Obama is trying to get the U.S. to comply with, can\u2019t have much to do with it.\n\nLyte\u2019s data comes from the International Campaign to Ban Landmines\u2019 annual Landmine Monitor, released that same day. So do all of her quotes. That\u2019s not a good sign: Journalism involves more than some cool new numbers from an NGO and reformatting a chart. Reading sources, securing contrary opinions, and knowing the context matters, too.\n\nThe data the ICBL produces is the best there is. But it\u2019s still not good, as the organization itself admits: \u201cData collection in various countries such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iraq, Myanmar, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen was believed to be incomplete.\u201d Of the 3,308 casualties, an easy majority \u2014 1,802 \u2014 occurred in these nations. This, as the ICBL acknowledges, \u201cmakes trends difficult to discern.\u201d\n\nSo the data isn\u2019t good enough to allow us to say much with certainty. Much worse, though, is that Lyte doesn\u2019t recognize that many of those 3,308 casualties weren\u2019t caused by anti-personnel land mines (APLs).\n\nThe ICBL\u2019s figures include both casualties caused by APLs and victim-activated IEDs (which are covered by the land-mine convention) and casualties caused by anti-vehicle mines, cluster munitions, and \u201cexplosive remnants of war\u201d (not covered by the convention).\n\nIn fact, according to the ICBL\u2019s figures, only about half the casualties it reports were caused by APLs and victim-activated IEDs. By far the deadliest kind of explosive device were the \u201cexplosive remnants of war,\u201d which are bombs and shells that did not detonate when used: in 2013, they caused 1,006 casualties. These casualties were not caused by APLs, and the ICBL doesn\u2019t claim they were.\n\nYet all of these numbers were related by FiveThirtyEight as land-mine deaths.\n\nIt\u2019s even harder to deal with trends in the data. The ICBL adjusted the casualty figures it reported before 2012 in light of new information, which makes historical comparisons difficult. But even in its most recent reports, trends are hard to spot. In 2012, the ICBL reported 468 victim-activated IED casualties. But in 2013, after adjusting its data again, it reported that 2012 had actually witnessed 1,169 such casualties, while 2013 supposedly saw only 671. APL casualties, by contrast, declined only slightly, from 937 in 2012 to 812 in 2013.\n\nIn short, the fall in casualties from 2012 to 2013 was driven almost entirely by the supposed decline in victim-activated IED casualties. There\u2019s no comparable fall in APL casualties. And if history is any guide, the IED casualty figures for 2013 will be revised up next year. I don\u2019t blame the ICBL for improving its data as better information becomes available. But its data doesn\u2019t support Lyte\u2019s reporting.\n\nSo, even leaving aside the poor quality of the data, we don\u2019t know if casualties are falling. Since four of the eight nations with the most casualties in 2013 aren\u2019t party to the convention, it doesn\u2019t deserve credit for anything that happened in those nations. And if casualties are falling, what\u2019s declined in the past year, mostly, is IED use. If you really believe that al-Qaeda is using fewer victim-activated IEDs because an inter-state treaty banned them, well, good luck to you.\n\nBut this story isn\u2019t just about numbers. It\u2019s also about context. The amount of unexploded ordnance in the world \u2013 and the number of IEDs used and APLs laid \u2013 is a lagged function of the number and viciousness of the world\u2019s wars. The late 1980s and 1990s saw a lot of these wars, in Afghanistan, Colombia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, and the former Yugoslavia, among other places.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that, as some of these wars cooled and unexploded was cleared, the number of casualties recorded by ICBL for its Landmine Report has declined. As war has come to Syria and Ukraine, and returned to Afghanistan, the next decade is likely to see more casualties. The anti-land-mine treaty is largely irrelevant to these trends.\n\nThat treaty, the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, isn\u2019t even the only treaty relevant to the problem. Land mines are also covered by Amended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which the U.S. ratified in 1999, and unexploded ordinance is covered by Protocol V (the U.S. consented in 2009). To the extent that casualties have fallen, it\u2019s likely that these protocols deserve at least some of the credit.\n\nBut the ICBL doesn\u2019t like the conventional-weapons treaty. In fact, the reason the newer anti-land-mine treaty exists is because its promoters hated the conventional-weapons treaty\u2019s process, which sought to regulate \u2013 not ban \u2013 APLs. The NGO-driven process that created the anti-land-mine treaty has more or less substituted moral fervor for serious diplomacy. By jumping outside the conventional-weapons process, the ICBL actually made it harder to negotiate new, consensus-based agreements inside the CCW. It is entirely possible that this fit of moral fervor will end more lives than it saves.\n\nFor all the attention paid to them, casualties caused by APLs are rare: according to the ICBL, only 812 injuries and deaths in the world in 2013. That doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t try to reduce them further, but land mines have been demonized out of proportion to the casualties they cause: The ICBL\u2019s own data shows that unexploded causes more harm than APLs. Moreover, APLs, if properly employed \u2013 as U.S. land mines are \u2014 can actually save the lives of civilians and U.S. forces alike by deterring attacks.\n\nThe defining aspect of the 2000s isn\u2019t declining land-mine casualties, and the Obama administration\u2019s push to comply with the APL convention is as irrelevant to humanitarian aims as it is dangerous militarily. But the real irony is that while the ICBL pats itself on the back for its progress in defeating the land-mine scourge, and the Obama administration applauds in the background, the most significant new weapon of war in the past decade is the insurgent\u2019s IED. In other words, Lyte\u2019s wrong: The land mine, so far as international law sees it, is not going away.\n\n\u2014 Ted R.

That is a challenge not unknown in Britain. But in the US, the more serious challenges come from shifts in the underlying political and ideological structure of the nation. These challenges, too, have their parallels in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat said, conservatives in Britain have something that their American brethren lack: a political party. If conservatism is to achieve successes in Britain, it must do so through the Conservative Party. By the same token, the Party plays an outsized role in defining what being a conservative means in Britain.\n\nOf course there are controversies about this \u2013 the Brexit saga springs to mind \u2013 but for all their changes, political parties in Britain have a fixity that the American ones lack. Over their long lives, the Democratic and Republican Parties have been both for and against everything.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that today, the Republican Party is the more conservative of the parties, as the word conservative is commonly understood. This fact is reflected in the rude health of the Republicans at the state level, where the GOP is as dominant today as it was in the 1920s.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that my conservative employer, the Heritage Foundation, was founded in 1973 \u2013 not to support Republican President Richard M. Nixon, but to oppose his policies of d\u00e9tente abroad and big government at home. The Republican Party is not the Conservative Party.\n\nFratricide \u2013 or disagreement about policies \u2013 is not an aberration on the American right. It is the normal condition of affairs. And though it has its inconveniences, disagreement may be more healthy over the long run than the left\u2019s assumption that the world must end in a state-fed, multiculturalist prison.\n\nThe real challenges facing conservatism in the US are structural. First, there is the near-disappearance of the sensible left \u2013 or liberals, as we used to call them. Britain experienced this in the 1920s when the Liberal Party collapsed. The US is seeing it now.\n\nToday, the dominant force on the left in the US is European-style leftism, which combines a worship of welfare with an inability to say when the state is big enough, an obsession with race and gender, and a dislike of standards that result in unequal outcomes.\n\nThis is a toxic mix. It owes nothing to genuine liberalism, and everything to the rise of the New Left. True, this left also exists in Britain, but in a parliamentary system, the answer on the political level is simple: win a majority, and the left can do little but complain from the sidelines.\n\nIn the US, the answer is not simple. The fading of liberalism (and the destruction of the conservative Democrats, known as the Blue Dogs) means that American politics have become more parliamentary in style. But winner-take-all politics sort ill with the separation of powers, which implies, as Reagan knew, that getting 70% of what you want is good enough (for now).\n\nThe second challenge to conservatism is that the US system is built on the assumption that, in a republic, Congress is naturally the first branch of government. There is a reason the US Capitol, not the White House, is on the highest ground in Washington, DC. We have no kings, and want none.\n\nOr at least we didn\u2019t. Today, while Congress often complains, it shows no actual desire to take power back from the White House, where decades of ill-considered legislation have delegated it. Indeed, Congress, like the left, finds this administrative state convenient: the left uses it to impose dictates without the trouble of legislation, while Congress uses it to avoid the trouble of actual responsibility.\n\nThis situation finds a parallel in Britain, where Remainers purport to be appalled by the idea of \u2018Henry VIII\u2019 powers, while being untroubled by the European Communities Act of 1972, which sidelined Parliament to a far greater extent than Henry VIII powers ever could. In the US, the administrative state violates the separation of powers. But in the US, conservatism exists as an independent movement, standing outside both parties, that can take umbrage when the GOP establishment defends that state.\n\nAnd that is where we are today. The Tea Party sought to remake the Republican Party, but the GOP establishment resisted it with success. So Trump came along, ran against that establishment, and won. But the problem today is not the clash between Trump and the establishment. Such clashes are healthy.\n\nThe problem is that, if Congress does not resume its proper place in the system, the US will remain dominated by executive power \u2014 an easy instrument for leftism to take up. Even in such an America, conservatism will remain a vital ideological force in the US, and powerful at the state level.\n\nBut without sensible liberals to win over or work with, conservatives will find it harder to win sustainable national victories against the administrative left, and popular discontent with the establishment in both parties will continue to grow, fueling more winner-take-all politics.\n\nIn short, American politics is becoming more British, with well-sorted and opposed political parties and a powerful executive. The problem is that ours is not a parliamentary system \u2013 and if Congress remains derelict in its duties, the new American system is not likely to be conservative.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a new strategy for confronting Iran offers a modicum of hope that the United States will stop kicking the can down the road in the Persian Gulf. But to do that, we have to recognize the point of the Iran nuclear deal wasn\u2019t to restrain Iran. It was to restrain the United States.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal may be the most poorly designed agreement the U.S. has ever signed. It gave Iran immediate relief from Western sanctions in return for Iranian pledges of good behavior in the future.\n\nIran knew that once sanctions were lifted, it would be hard for us to re-impose them. To do that, we need European cooperation, and with Iranian dollars flowing to Europe\u2019s industries, we\u2019re unlikely to get it.\n\nThe Iran deal destroyed the means by which we could enforce the Iran deal. It rendered itself unenforceable. That makes it a bad deal.\n\nNow, the people who negotiated the Iran deal weren\u2019t dumb. So why did they negotiate a bad deal? Simple: The Iran nuclear deal wasn\u2019t intended primarily to control Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It was intended to eliminate Iran\u2019s nuclear program as an issue in U.S. politics.\n\nThe idea of a deal to control Iran\u2019s nuclear program never made much sense. If Iran genuinely wanted a purely civilian nuclear program, we wouldn\u2019t need a deal to control it.\n\nWe didn\u2019t need a deal on Finland\u2019s nuclear program, for example, because \u2013 unlike Iran \u2013 Finland\u2019s a democracy that makes no fuss about regular IAEA inspections.\n\nThe real end game of the Iran nuclear deal was to enlist Iran as a U.S. partner in the region. President Obama acknowledged this in January 2014. Obama said he wanted \u201ca new geostrategic equilibrium\u201d in the region. But to get that, he needed partners. A prime candidate for that role, he explained, was Iran.\n\nBut as long as the U.S. was focused on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the U.S. was never going to get Obama\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive agreement\u201d with Iran. Nor could Iran become, as Obama hoped, \u201ca very successful regional power.\u201d\n\nObama therefore sought to get the Iranians to accept a deal \u2013 any deal. That would turn the U.S. focus away from Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and onto the deal itself.\n\nAnd that is what happened. We\u2019re not focusing on Iran\u2018s conduct any more. We\u2019re focusing on the nuclear deal itself \u2013 which comes equipped with one of Obama\u2019s patented straw men, that anyone who opposes the deal is a warmonger.\n\nNonsense. The one thing the Sunni powers \u2013 led by the Saudis \u2013 don\u2019t want is to see Iran become \u201ca very successful regional power.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. By feeding Sunni fears, the nuclear deal sets the stage for a big regional war.\n\nThe problem is that, thanks to the deal, the U.S.\u2019s best tool for restraining Iran without war \u2013 sanctions \u2013 lies in ruins.\n\nSanctions aren\u2019t like a parking gate that swings easily up and down. They\u2019re like a medieval cathedral: they take ages to build. We should re-impose them, a decision Trump has kicked to Congress. But we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves about their effectiveness.\n\nA better policy doesn\u2019t start with sanctions. It starts with rejecting Obama\u2019s core assumption: that Iran is a useful regional partner for the U.S. The Iran deal is merely a symptom of that assumption. Rejecting it means opposing Iranian influence across the Levant.\n\nBut as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson noted, the U.S. decided not to put Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations \u2013 because that would impede U.S. military cooperation with Iran in Syria. Yet Iran\u2019s military role in Syria is central to its regional influence.\n\nTrump clearly regards the Iran deal as a bad one \u2013 and he\u2019s right. But unless his administration rejects the assumption underlying the deal, decertifying the deal won\u2019t do much more than give the can another kick down the road."]
